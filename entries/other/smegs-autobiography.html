[14-Apr-20 04:32 PM] snekky#6713
i am going to assume that this is a properly locked channel


[14-Apr-20 04:33 PM] snekky#6713
but it's in general category so i don't believe you


[14-Apr-20 04:34 PM] snekky#6713
why is it in general chat


[14-Apr-20 04:34 PM] snekky#6713
this is gay


[14-Apr-20 04:34 PM] Pixela#2609
Because we don't have a non-fanfic category


[14-Apr-20 04:35 PM] Pixela#2609
So enjoy your generalness while it lasts


[14-Apr-20 04:35 PM] snekky#6713
retard


[14-Apr-20 04:35 PM] Pixela#2609
Ok


[14-Apr-20 04:37 PM] snekky#6713
ok so basically this definitely won't be neatly put into chapters


[14-Apr-20 04:37 PM] snekky#6713
i am barely sane enough to write without going on a tangent about racism


[14-Apr-20 04:38 PM] snekky#6713
1. i am a man because this is still a confusing subject apparently


[14-Apr-20 04:39 PM] snekky#6713
2. no i do not have a secret alt embedded in tgn discord if it's not completely desert


[14-Apr-20 04:40 PM] snekky#6713
ok so basically i started playing on tgn on 1.13 world


[14-Apr-20 04:40 PM] snekky#6713
i do not know the exact date because wargen is a cuck


[14-Apr-20 04:40 PM] snekky#6713
was it january?


[14-Apr-20 04:41 PM] snekky#6713
so yeah i joined red dock


[14-Apr-20 04:41 PM] snekky#6713
reasoning:
- it's red
- it's dock


[14-Apr-20 04:41 PM] snekky#6713
i did not take enough time to observe that i was about to join a dying town


[14-Apr-20 04:41 PM] snekky#6713
but whatever


[14-Apr-20 04:42 PM] snekky#6713
so i became a member of red dock


[14-Apr-20 04:42 PM] snekky#6713
humble life


[14-Apr-20 04:42 PM] snekky#6713
made a house


[14-Apr-20 04:42 PM] snekky#6713
mine diamonds


[14-Apr-20 04:42 PM] snekky#6713
buy things


[14-Apr-20 04:43 PM] snekky#6713
[timing may be wrong here because i have no reference]


[14-Apr-20 04:44 PM] snekky#6713
here is how my quirkyness in the server started


[14-Apr-20 04:44 PM] snekky#6713
remember spartan?


[14-Apr-20 04:44 PM] snekky#6713
remember 6 hours server reboot?


[14-Apr-20 04:44 PM] snekky#6713
i joined the group that built the furnace wall


[14-Apr-20 04:44 PM] snekky#6713
it was fun while it lasted


[14-Apr-20 04:44 PM] snekky#6713
NSA allowed it because he did not foresee the consequences


[14-Apr-20 04:45 PM] snekky#6713
and during that time i spent mining cobble


[14-Apr-20 04:45 PM] snekky#6713
a certain someone got my interest in chat


[14-Apr-20 04:46 PM] snekky#6713
*Koion*


[14-Apr-20 04:46 PM] snekky#6713
he was asking for a good hentai sauce to make a map art with


[14-Apr-20 04:46 PM] snekky#6713
here is where i come in


[14-Apr-20 04:46 PM] snekky#6713

[14-Apr-20 04:47 PM] snekky#6713
i packed up some of my things from my home in red dock


[14-Apr-20 04:47 PM] snekky#6713
and headed to what will be known as opportunity


[14-Apr-20 04:47 PM] Pixela#2609
Those two sentences are the reason we split from teenserv


[14-Apr-20 04:47 PM] snekky#6713
which ones


[14-Apr-20 04:47 PM] Pixela#2609
The screenshots


[14-Apr-20 04:48 PM] snekky#6713
h


[14-Apr-20 04:48 PM] snekky#6713
i barely have any screenshots of oppo and stuffs now because wargen


[14-Apr-20 04:48 PM] snekky#6713
so this story will mostly be plaintext


[14-Apr-20 04:48 PM] snekky#6713
@Pixela were the corner chests still there by the reset?


[14-Apr-20 04:49 PM] Pixela#2609
I'm pretty sure they were


[14-Apr-20 04:49 PM] snekky#6713
amazing


[14-Apr-20 04:49 PM] snekky#6713
what about the 5x5 house next to it


[14-Apr-20 04:49 PM] snekky#6713
i forgot


[14-Apr-20 04:50 PM] Pixela#2609
It got converted into a stable with paintings


[14-Apr-20 04:50 PM] Pixela#2609
Still 5x5 though


[14-Apr-20 04:50 PM] snekky#6713
so it didn't get demolished


[14-Apr-20 04:50 PM] snekky#6713
amazing


[14-Apr-20 04:50 PM] snekky#6713
right so those structures you saw in oppo were where i settled my things and met up with koion


[14-Apr-20 04:51 PM] snekky#6713
after an unexpectedly long argument in discord DM deciding on an image


[14-Apr-20 04:52 PM] snekky#6713
in which i convinced him to make miia map art


[14-Apr-20 04:52 PM] snekky#6713
we decided on this one


[14-Apr-20 04:52 PM] snekky#6713
(to keep with my theme of posting hentai in sfw channel)

[14-Apr-20 04:53 PM] snekky#6713
and so the first foundation of opportunity was made

[14-Apr-20 04:54 PM] snekky#6713
by this time i had already established myself in red dock


[14-Apr-20 04:54 PM] snekky#6713
everyone knew me


[14-Apr-20 04:55 PM] snekky#6713
after some wall and 2 banners


[14-Apr-20 04:55 PM] snekky#6713
i convinced james


[14-Apr-20 04:55 PM] snekky#6713
to make a channel for this location


[14-Apr-20 04:56 PM] snekky#6713
opportunity was the name we decided on as it was around the time that the rover's mission is declared completed


[14-Apr-20 04:56 PM] snekky#6713
so there was an #opportunity channel in red dock server


[14-Apr-20 04:57 PM] snekky#6713
fox and i got a flashy role


[14-Apr-20 04:57 PM] snekky#6713
work on the map art continued


[14-Apr-20 04:57 PM] snekky#6713
mostly mining quartz


[14-Apr-20 04:58 PM] snekky#6713
during this time we got red dock citizens to build houses on the land


[14-Apr-20 04:58 PM] snekky#6713
and convinced new players to join us


[14-Apr-20 04:58 PM] snekky#6713
i still didn't have a proper house


[14-Apr-20 04:58 PM] Pixela#2609
Haha me


[14-Apr-20 04:58 PM] Pixela#2609
I leeched off a tour smeg gave to someone who never played again


[14-Apr-20 04:59 PM] snekky#6713
population were rising


[14-Apr-20 04:59 PM] snekky#6713
james and pen disagreed on opportunity's position and if it should be its own town


[14-Apr-20 05:00 PM] snekky#6713
not long after i discovered a fatal mistake in the plan


[14-Apr-20 05:00 PM] snekky#6713
the map was upside down, the town faces south


[14-Apr-20 05:00 PM] snekky#6713
this would not be much problem on its own


[14-Apr-20 05:00 PM] snekky#6713
but koion, now foxrace did not know how maps work


[14-Apr-20 05:00 PM] snekky#6713
and the map art was 1x1 chunk misaligned


[14-Apr-20 05:02 PM] snekky#6713
by that time i didn't have much interest in moving the map art and continue


[14-Apr-20 05:02 PM] snekky#6713
as the then colony was growing fast


[14-Apr-20 05:02 PM] snekky#6713
there were many things to do


[14-Apr-20 05:02 PM] snekky#6713
i was becoming known in the server


[14-Apr-20 05:02 PM] snekky#6713
partly because i shitposted in the discord server a lot


[14-Apr-20 05:03 PM] snekky#6713
i won't go into much detail about opportunity


[14-Apr-20 05:03 PM] snekky#6713
there really isn't much to talk about


[14-Apr-20 05:03 PM] snekky#6713
after the town has made its place on the server then it's nothing interesting to talk about


[14-Apr-20 05:03 PM] snekky#6713
just a town that grew very big


[14-Apr-20 05:04 PM] snekky#6713
and that pretty much concluded what i did on 1.13 server


[14-Apr-20 05:04 PM] snekky#6713
let's talk about discord


[14-Apr-20 05:04 PM] snekky#6713
i was notorious for two things on the server


[14-Apr-20 05:05 PM] snekky#6713
posting anime and demanding feet pics


[14-Apr-20 05:05 PM] snekky#6713
as my interest in tgn dropped and dropped i cared less for what could happen on the discord


[14-Apr-20 05:06 PM] snekky#6713
so despite being muted and banned multiple times, why did i keep on posting even when i knew that the next one is permanent?


[14-Apr-20 05:06 PM] snekky#6713
i think it's fun


[14-Apr-20 05:07 PM] snekky#6713
the reactions of people were fun


[14-Apr-20 05:07 PM] snekky#6713
and that i am a degenerate but that is pretty much known


[14-Apr-20 05:07 PM] snekky#6713
no mystery there


[14-Apr-20 05:08 PM] snekky#6713
as for the feet pics i am not sure how it started but i ended up getting a lot


[14-Apr-20 05:08 PM] snekky#6713
don't worry most of them are gone now


[14-Apr-20 05:08 PM] snekky#6713
i don't think i was that much of an asshole on tgn server itself


[14-Apr-20 05:09 PM] snekky#6713
but if you were ever active in a smaller server with me in it you probably noticed


[14-Apr-20 05:09 PM] snekky#6713
hearing a &quot;thank you&quot; was a notable occasion in red dock


[14-Apr-20 05:09 PM] snekky#6713
and james said that &quot;smeg never said anything nice to anyone&quot; or smth like that


[14-Apr-20 05:09 PM] snekky#6713
i would just get the fucking screenshot if not for wargen


[14-Apr-20 05:10 PM] snekky#6713
so there i was shitposting and arguing about politics in red dock


[14-Apr-20 05:11 PM] snekky#6713
meanwhile i recruited some people, many of those are the originals in opportunity


[14-Apr-20 05:11 PM] snekky#6713
for my new town in 1.14


[14-Apr-20 05:11 PM] snekky#6713
i told wargen to lock red dock server when 1.14 dropped


[14-Apr-20 05:11 PM] snekky#6713
and locked the server he did


[14-Apr-20 05:11 PM] snekky#6713
and hole was born


[14-Apr-20 05:12 PM] snekky#6713
it was a town about digging holes


[14-Apr-20 05:12 PM] snekky#6713
and dig holes we did


[14-Apr-20 05:12 PM] snekky#6713
ok fine there wasn't as much digging as i would like


[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713
i started a new map art


[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713
it was going well


[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713
i took a lot of screenshot to prepare for the time lapse at the end


[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713
but of course there is a catch


[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713
i needed a metric fuckton of snow


[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713
so there i was farming a snow golem


[14-Apr-20 05:14 PM] snekky#6713
i visited some red dock people during this time


[14-Apr-20 05:14 PM] snekky#6713
mostly just pen and kai's base


[14-Apr-20 05:15 PM] snekky#6713
so i asked kai if they were interested in farming a snow golem to help me gather snow


[14-Apr-20 05:15 PM] snekky#6713
and then i set up a farming station in their base


[14-Apr-20 05:15 PM] snekky#6713
moved it downstairs after a complaint from pen


[14-Apr-20 05:16 PM] snekky#6713
some days later i came to collect my snow and discovered two things


[14-Apr-20 05:16 PM] snekky#6713
1.kai did not farm any snow


[14-Apr-20 05:16 PM] snekky#6713
2.pen got me killed


[14-Apr-20 05:17 PM] snekky#6713
oh yeah i didn't mention my deaths at all


[14-Apr-20 05:17 PM] snekky#6713
i died from clogging a lot


[14-Apr-20 05:18 PM] snekky#6713
i died to a giant mushroom


[14-Apr-20 05:18 PM] snekky#6713
but that's not part of the story


[14-Apr-20 05:18 PM] snekky#6713
so after i lost my 100th god set since 1.13 started


[14-Apr-20 05:18 PM] snekky#6713
hole imploded


[14-Apr-20 05:18 PM] snekky#6713
obscene amount of expletives were sent


[14-Apr-20 05:19 PM] snekky#6713
and i barely played after that


[14-Apr-20 05:19 PM] snekky#6713
then i just went back to shitpost on discord (just hole now)


[14-Apr-20 05:19 PM] snekky#6713
and hole did not get very far


[14-Apr-20 05:19 PM] snekky#6713
everyone slowly felt that tgn sucked balls and left


[14-Apr-20 05:19 PM] snekky#6713
fox kept playing


[14-Apr-20 05:20 PM] snekky#6713
if you check tgn's minecraft chat you will see that i join to say &quot;sex&quot; &quot;pee&quot; &quot;penis&quot; or &quot;cum&quot; every other day


[14-Apr-20 05:20 PM] snekky#6713
so i am still shitposting to this day


[14-Apr-20 05:20 PM] snekky#6713
enough about minecraft


[14-Apr-20 05:20 PM] snekky#6713
time to talk about myself


[14-Apr-20 05:21 PM] snekky#6713
1. i do not watch as much anime as you may have thought


[14-Apr-20 05:21 PM] snekky#6713
in fact i watch less that your average anime watchers


[14-Apr-20 05:21 PM] snekky#6713
surprising i know


[14-Apr-20 05:21 PM] snekky#6713
but i do know my shit enough to post hentai


[14-Apr-20 05:22 PM] snekky#6713
2. fox has been waiting on his megaman pfp (like james' and pixela's) for almost a year now because i never do anything properly and on time


[14-Apr-20 05:23 PM] snekky#6713
3.i draw once every month so that pretty much makes me a great artist


[14-Apr-20 05:23 PM] snekky#6713
4. reminding you again that i am a man and identify as male if you call me a fucking egg i will literally eat you


[14-Apr-20 05:24 PM] snekky#6713
ok a bit more serious topic this time


[14-Apr-20 05:24 PM] snekky#6713
during my time in hole (hole still exists, but in another form) i have said a lot about my life so i will post some here


[14-Apr-20 05:26 PM] snekky#6713

[14-Apr-20 05:27 PM] snekky#6713
i am definitely the person you can put the label of &quot;asshole&quot; on without anyone doubting that


[14-Apr-20 05:27 PM] snekky#6713

most of you reading this are near the lowest point


[14-Apr-20 05:28 PM] snekky#6713
the important question is probably &quot;why?&quot;


[14-Apr-20 05:29 PM] snekky#6713
i don't actually quite feel any &quot;high&quot; from it


[14-Apr-20 05:29 PM] snekky#6713
it just is


[14-Apr-20 05:30 PM] snekky#6713
&quot;doesn't this conflict with the answer you gave loboga?&quot;


[14-Apr-20 05:30 PM] snekky#6713
it does


[14-Apr-20 05:31 PM] snekky#6713
i can explain on that but tbh i don't think this fits much into the rest of my write up


[14-Apr-20 05:31 PM] snekky#6713
like what i said about the graph


[14-Apr-20 05:31 PM] snekky#6713
most of you are in the &quot;safe zone&quot; and those who aren't can get information from me elsewhere


[14-Apr-20 05:32 PM] snekky#6713
&quot;does mental health come into play? are you depressed/bipolar/deranged/insane/schizophrenic?&quot;


[14-Apr-20 05:32 PM] snekky#6713
it does


[14-Apr-20 05:32 PM] snekky#6713
but not directly


[14-Apr-20 05:32 PM] snekky#6713
i *was* depressed


[14-Apr-20 05:32 PM] snekky#6713
i am mostly normal now


[14-Apr-20 05:33 PM] snekky#6713
but the bitter side of my personality mostly comes after the depression


[14-Apr-20 05:33 PM] snekky#6713
it changed me quite a lot


[14-Apr-20 05:34 PM] snekky#6713
oh wait i am going on a tangent again


[14-Apr-20 05:34 PM] snekky#6713
so yeah if you have left my server or experienced my asshattery you get a part of the explaination now


[14-Apr-20 05:35 PM] snekky#6713
contact me if you really want to know more (you don't)


[14-Apr-20 05:35 PM] snekky#6713
&quot;smeg why are you being fucking edgy?&quot;


[14-Apr-20 05:35 PM] snekky#6713
i have embraced being edgy


[14-Apr-20 05:36 PM] snekky#6713
i don't think i get my &quot;high&quot; from insulting people actually


[14-Apr-20 05:36 PM] snekky#6713
it's from anger


[14-Apr-20 05:36 PM] snekky#6713
i get my &quot;high&quot; from the anger i feel in an argument


[14-Apr-20 05:37 PM] snekky#6713
that's why you can see me argue about stupid shits all the time


[14-Apr-20 05:37 PM] snekky#6713
&quot;who the hell are you i have never heard of you before&quot;


[14-Apr-20 05:37 PM] snekky#6713
good


[14-Apr-20 05:38 PM] snekky#6713
i think i shallowly covered everything


[14-Apr-20 05:39 PM] snekky#6713
i might expand on a specific subject some other time


[14-Apr-20 05:39 PM] snekky#6713
also if you remembered me as being mute i am no longer mute
