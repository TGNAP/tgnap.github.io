Mi6</h2> <p>&quot;Ya'll regret defying me,&quot; a voice rang throughout the world. &quot;Mark my words. I will gain a following, then construct my infrastructure. I will hire assassins to kill my enemies, stockpile their resources! Then, the real fun begins. As soon as people go outside, we will kill them. The military forces of the world will give up and surrender to us. Before you even know it, I will have taken control over the world.&quot;</p> <p>Everyone laughed at their TV's. Someone really hacked into popular news networks, and scripted such a terrible monologue! And he looked so serious as well!</p> <p>Whilst the news anchors took their security breach, and thus the consequent message, quite seriously, the general public turned him into a meme instantly. Whenever someone was mildly inconvenienced by another, they would just have to say &quot;Ya'll regret&quot; and the whole room would burst out laughing, remembering the man who looked like a child who didn't get his ice cream.</p> <p>//</p> <p>It was Shadow's first day joining the Mi6, after years of honing his skills and body, as well as the skill only he knew about. He woke up that morning and washed his face, his legs almost shaking. Whether it was from nervousness or from excitement, he did not know.</p> <p>He put on his best suit, and took the underground to Vauxhall. He looked at the people around him, wondering what lives they were leading, what aspirations they had and whether he would be successful. He convinced himself that they wouldn't have accepted him if they hadn't seen any potential.</p> <p>He finally arrived at the Mi6 headquarters, and just stood outside the door, expecting some high-tech scanning system to come out of the walls or something. He stood there awkwardly for a moment when he noticed a receptionist tapping at the window and pointing at the wall next to him. He saw that there was an intercom and pressed it. After a few moments, it buzzed and he opened the door.</p> <p>He walked by the receptionist, flustered and barely muttering a word of thanks, when she called back after him. &quot;So what are you here for?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Oh, uhh.&quot; Shadow started to overthink his words, his embarrassment taking over his brain as he thought about his past actions. &quot;I think I'm here for uhhm&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You think?&quot; the receptionist interjected. &quot;Just tell me your name and I'll find where you should be.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Oh it's Shadow.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Last name?&quot;</p> <p>Shadow bit his lip. He hated his last name. &quot;Lune&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Ok.. Lune, Shadow,&quot; she muttered to herself while typing. &quot;Ah, you're the newbie. Take a seat here and you'll be collected shortly,&quot; she said, nodding towards a leather sofa.</p> <p>Shadow complied, and slumped onto the sofa, trying to cast away the series of embarrassing things he just did.</p> <p>He looked around and took in all of his surroundings. He was in a pretty large entrance room, which had windows from the floor to the ceiling all around. Opposite the entrance, next to the reception were two corridors. According to the signs, one led to the elevators and the cleaning closet, and the other led to a row of rooms. He could just barely see someone typing at a computer in the closest room to him.</p> <p>His daydreaming was interrupted by someone calling his name. &quot;Shadow?&quot;</p> <p>He refocused and saw someone standing next to him. &quot;Are you Shadow?&quot; the man asked.</p> <p>&quot;Yeah I am, are you picking me up?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yup, I'm Theo. Can you follow me please.&quot; Theo started to walk towards the corridor containing the elevators, and Shadow followed behind him.</p> <p>&quot;So I'll be the one deciding what team you'll be placed in, which means we'll have to do a little test. Don't worry though, it won't be difficult, just more of a measure of your character and physical strength,&quot; Theo explained to him.</p> <p>Finally, the elevator stopped and they got out. Theo led him to a room, and pulled the door open for Shadow.</p> <p>Shadow thanked him and as he walked through the door, he saw a massive object hurtling through the air at him!</p> <h2 id="chapter-2-a-briefing"><a href="#chapter-2-a-briefing" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 2 - A briefing</h2> <p>Instantly, an ethereal body exited Shadow's body and landed two punches on the object. The thing still flew undisturbed, but as it reached Shadow's head, it just changed shape around him, like a liquid.</p> <p>Shadow heard a thunk behind him, and turned to see Theo on the floor. The large object, which turned out to be a wooden drawer, now lay down on top of Theo's chest. It clearly hit him in the stomach.</p> <p>Shadow helped pull the drawer off Theo, and Theo stormed into the room. &quot;Mboo! What the hell are you doing!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Hehe, sorry boss. You said he might have a stand, so I felt like doing this would be way quicker than doing a while boring test to make him use it,&quot; a girl inside the room replied, sticking her tongue out playfully.</p> <p>&quot;Ugh I hate you. I was right about him having a stand so you're never going to think you made a mistake.&quot; Theo shook his head and turned back to Shadow. &quot;Right. So I <em>was</em> going to make you take a test that would hopefully bring out your stand, but I guess we don't need to do that anymore.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;How did you know I had a.. stand thing? That was really risky,&quot; Shadow asked, a bit unnerved about what had just transpired.</p> <p>&quot;I read your file and records and some of it seemed a bit strange. Almost all of your arrests included you taking on multiple people much larger than you and winning. A lot of these people were serial killers and rapists, so you didn't get by on luck alone. While you have my respect for your sense of justice, you're not allowed to do any more vigilante justice, especially in revenge.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Now, onto business,&quot; Theo continued. &quot;You'll be joining my team. You've already seen Mboo and had a taste of her stand ability. Also, just so you know, everyone in my team has stand abilities, which is why I specifically asked to test you. There are two others on my team, and I'll introduce them to you now.&quot;</p> <p>He went up to two doors on the side of the room and banged on them hard. &quot;Pen, Cipicao, wake up! The newbie's here.&quot;</p> <p>About a minute later, a man came out of one of the doors, rubbing his eyes groggily. He noticed Shadow and looked him up and down. &quot;You, you don't like anime do you?&quot;</p> <p>Shadow was confused. &quot;Uh, I don't mind it, I guess?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Oh my GOD!&quot; he punched the wall, and Shadow noticed that there was a puncture hole about 4 inches deep where the man punched. &quot;So I've had to deal with two weebs on my team up until now, and now there's another one! Theo PLEASE transfer me to another team.&quot;</p> <p>Theo sighed. &quot;Pen, we talked about this. This is the only stand team in the Mi6 and you've learnt too much to just be moved to a less essential team. Now where's Cipicao?&quot;</p> <p>Right on cue, another man started opening the door and smiled as he saw Shadow. &quot;Hi, I'm Cipicao! You're Lune, right?&quot;</p> <p>Shadow tried to ignore the use of his last name, especially as Cipicao was being so cordial. &quot;Hi, please, call me Shadow!&quot;</p> <p>After the pair shook hands, Theo called them to the table in the centre of the room. After they all sat down, Pen making an effort to stay away from the people he deemed degenerates, Theo started to talk.</p> <p>&quot;Right, our mission is to track down the person who hacked into all the TV stations and sent his message.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;That guy?&quot; Shadow interrupted. &quot;I thought he was just a joke.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;The public made him into a joke, which I don't know is a good or bad thing. Luckily, they won't panic, but his humiliation might make him more desperate to do something big,&quot; Theo replied. &quot;The other teams did some tracking, and we managed to find his name, or at least one of the ones he uses. He's called yp6, and we think he's originally American.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Now, here's the thing,&quot; Theo continued. &quot;In the video he sent, he seems to be standing in a public place, in front of the  One World Trade Center in fact, but we've checked the security cameras, and there's no record of him even being there.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Couldn't he have just used greenscreen?&quot; Shadow asked.</p> <p>Theo shook his head and brought out a laptop. &quot;See for yourself.&quot; He played the video and the group watched carefully.</p> <p>It took a while, but Pen noticed something. &quot;The camera's moving naturally, and consistently. It was filmed by hand. yp6 even interacts with objects that are meshed seamlessly into the background. He was definitely there. You can't get that level of detail without greenscreen or making a whole new set.&quot;</p> <p>Shadow sat back in his seat and resigned to the logic, until something clicked in his head. &quot;What if he did make a whole new set? Can we check for someone purchasing a large amount of land and videography equipment? The detail in which this is made had to be used using the same quality equipment as big budget films, even if it's on a smaller scale.&quot;</p> <p>Theo nodded, and replied. &quot;We could do that, but we'd have to go to the Pentagon and conduct the search under close supervision. Even if the UK and US are allies, no one trusts each other, especially when it comes to secret matters.&quot;</p> <p>Theo closed the laptop and put it back into his bag. &quot;We've sent spies into America, but we've lost connection with all of them suddenly. There's a high chance the enemy is a stand user himself, or commands people with stand abilities. It is very likely that we may die. Are we all ok with that?&quot; He made eye contact with each and every person in the room, until they all nodded.</p> <p>&quot;Then let's get ready.&quot;</p> <h2 id="chapter-3-riding-on-a-jet"><a href="#chapter-3-riding-on-a-jet" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 3 - Riding on a Jet</h2> <p>The group met outside Mi6 headquarters, and got into a truck. Shadow was quite excited. This was his first time going to another continent. His most exotic holiday was going to Spain for a couple weeks, which, while enjoyable, felt scripted. It was just get there, swim, eat food, go back to the hotel, rinse and repeat. This was different, it was adventurous. He knew he shouldn't feel this way on a mission, but he didn't care.</p> <p>The rest of the group seemed tired, as if this was just their way of life, which, Shadow reasoned, it was. He looked out of the window, staring at the trees that passed them by. He always liked British landscapes. Other people seemed to think it was featureless and boring, but he liked to see the plains where farmers living simple lives cared for their crops and animals. He had great respect for farmers. Not only were they self-sufficient, but they contributed to society in the most fundamental way.</p> <p>This kept on for about an hour, until they reached an abandoned airfield that had a singular, black and grey jet. As he entered, Shadow noticed that it was pretty high class aeroplane. There were seats that you could just drop into and fall asleep instantly, and a small buffet at the back. There was also a table in the middle, probably meant for meetings while in the air.</p> <p>The group chose seats, and sat down, Cipicao and Mboo falling asleep. Theo started playing minesweeper on his phone, whilst Shadow started reading a book on Physics. Pen paced around the room, no doubt thinking of ways to exorcise his weeb teammates.</p> <p>After a while, Pen got tired, and went into the buffet room to drink some water. He also felt a bit hungry, so he opened the fridge. When he opened it, he saw that all the apples looked browned and shrunk, like all its water had been sucked out.</p> <p>&quot;Oh come onnn,&quot; he complained loudly. &quot;They send us on a 4 hour trip, and they pack rotten apples!&quot;</p> <p>Theo noticed Pen's loud drawling and replied. &quot;They shouldn't be rotten, HQ said all the food was new, and they were packed directly into the fridge.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Come and look for yourself then!&quot; Pen replied, gesturing at the fridge excessively.</p> <p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Theo replied, and he walked to the buffet area. He looked into the fridge and, surprisingly, he saw that the apples were in fact rotten. He checked the other foods as well, and saw that they all looked as if they were months old. &quot;Ok, so they're rotten. I'll write a complaint to HQ, but for now, take a nap. You look like you could use one.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What does that mean? You're not looking too good yourself!&quot; Pen replied angrily.</p> <p>&quot;Go to sleep Pen, you're clearly tired and I don't want to have to deal with you now,&quot; Theo said sternly.</p> <p>&quot;Fine! I'll sleep, and you'll see that I won't be any different when I wake up.&quot;</p> <p>Theo went back to his seat as well, and was just about bring out his phone when he heard a crash behind him. He stuck his head out swiftly and saw Pen lying on the floor, clearly having fainted.</p> <p>Theo rushed up to him and called his name. &quot;Pen! Are you ok? Pen?!&quot; Theo turned Pen so he faced upwards and saw that Pen's face looked malnourished. &quot;Everyone, help me take care of Pen!&quot;</p> <p>There was no response. &quot;Guys! What are you doing? I said get up!&quot;</p> <p>He got up to his feet and went to Cipicao and Mboo's row, and saw that they had their heads down, asleep. As he brought their faces up to slap them awake he saw that they too seemed like they had been starving for weeks.</p> <p>Unsettled, he checked Shadow. The same thing happened to him. He ran to the mirror, recalling what Pen said about him. As he saw himself, his spirits fell. His face looked almost identical to theirs. He could start to feel his legs barely being able to support him. He only had a few minutes before he too would pass out.</p> <p>He realised that the plane was falling, and he rushed to the cockpit. He pulled open the door, using all of his rapidly depleting strength and saw the captain pushing the controls down, smiling widely at him.</p> <p>&quot;So, you're the only one still awake? Impressive, but I'm afraid you can't do anything anymore. Even if you tried to attack me, I hear your stand is wild. What if you hit the controls and broke them, leaving the plane hurtling towards the ground and killing you and your friends?&quot;</p> <p>The pilot laughed manically. &quot;What will you do, Theo?&quot;</p> <h2 id="chapter-4-in-the-air"><a href="#chapter-4-in-the-air" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 4 - In the Air</h2> <p>Theo took some steps back despairingly. He knew the pilot was right. His stand was too violent to just hit the pilot once and recall it.</p> <p>His drastic thinking was cut off by the pilot. &quot;My stand, Toto, sucks the nutrients out of whatever I wish. As you can see, you have no escape from my ability. You will die to me, Leon! Also, to ensure you don't get any funny ideas, I'll do this!&quot;</p> <p>He reached towards Theo with one arm, and a ghostly one extended out of his own. Instinctively, Theo brought up his own to block, but Leon did not stop. His palm touched Theo's left arm and instantly, it started to shrivel up.</p> <p>Theo jumped back, holding his nearly limp hand up with his right.</p> <p>&quot;I can also rapidly deplete the nutrients of anything my stand's palm touches. Now you know what'll happen if you get any ideas,&quot; Leon said menacingly.</p> <p>&quot;You know, you might think that that would be enough to scare me off, and you may be right. If I were alone, I might've given up just like that. But you forgot one thing,&quot; Theo said, his courage building up.</p> <p>&quot;This is my team, and I won't let them die! I call your bluff!&quot;</p> <p>He walked to the cockpit, a fire of rage in his eyes. He stood next to the pilot, bringing out his stand.</p> <p>&quot;What? What's that, what are you doing?&quot; Leon said, looking at the presence exiting Theo's body with great fear.</p> <p>&quot;Letting you taste some action.&quot;</p> <p>Theo punched with his free arm, and his stand did the same. As Leon saw the fist go towards his face, he started to emit a shrill scream from his mouth.</p> <p>The ethereal fist made contact, and Theo let loose a one-handed barrage against the pilot.</p> <p>&quot;Shineshineshineshineshineshineshine!&quot;  his stand cried, getting louder each time its right hand made contact.</p> <p>After a few seconds, Theo used all his effort to recall his stand before it did any more damage to the cabin. He rushed back to the seating area and went to Mboo, dragging her back to the cabin while trying to slap her awake. Now that Leon had been defeated, his effects should start to reverse. Theo could already feel his left hand start to fill back up.</p> <p>As he placed Mboo into the cockpit, she started to wake up. &quot;What's happening?&quot; she asked sleepily.</p> <p>&quot;There's no time to explain, just try rearrange the cockpit with your stand!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What? You want me to fix this massive thing <em>and</em> fly a plane? What makes you think I can do either of those? Where's the captain?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Just fix the goddamn plane!&quot; Theo shouted.</p> <p>Mboo recoiled, clearly not used to Theo shouting at her.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and focused on the space around her. She felt that there were many plates and wires bent and out of place, and she tried to restore them, feeling where things clicked together.</p> <p>&quot;I'm done, I think!&quot; she called back to Theo, who was now waking the others.</p> <p>&quot;Alright, can you try fly it? It should have a destination automatically put in so if you just pull up and turn autopilot on it'll work.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I'll try, but you know I'm not a pilot!&quot; she bent down and squinted at the controls, looking for where an autopilot button might be when she noticed something.</p> <p>&quot;Uh boss? I don't know if I'm reading this right but it seems like this plane is set to go to Utah?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What? No that's impos- I'll check where we are on my laptop,&quot; Theo called back.</p> <p>He opened his laptop swiftly and looked on his maps. He searched for where they were and his eyes widened.</p> <p>&quot;Everyone, out! We're over Illinois! Get parachutes, we're jumping off the plane.&quot;</p> <p>By this time, everyone was at least partially aware of what was happening. They all got parachutes, making sure that they were put on properly and Theo went to the door, ready to open it.</p> <p>Mboo managed to somewhat stabilise the plane, and the group jumped out one by one, Theo coming out after everyone else.</p> <p>The wind rushed by their faces, as they tried not to panic, knowing that if they fainted before they pulled the string, they would be dead without exception. They reached around 200 metres above ground before Theo tried to shout for everyone to pull their parachutes, but it was lost in the wind.</p> <p>Thankfully, they all had good intuition, and pulled the strings. They watched the plane fly into the distance, as they realised the depth of their situation.</p> <p>They landed, exhausted and they took shelter at an abandoned gas station.</p> <h2 id="chapter-5-oh-we-re-lost"><a href="#chapter-5-oh-we-re-lost" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 5 - Oh, we're lost</h2> <p>Everyone looked a little unnerved at what just happened. No one dared to say a word.</p> <p>Finally, someone broke the silence. &quot;So, are you going to tell us why we just jumped out of the plane and landed in the middle of nowhere?&quot; Pen asked.</p> <p>Theo took a deep breath and explained. &quot;Our pilot was an enemy stand user. I don't know how he got on, or even if he was the original pilot, but this does confirm our belief that yp6 has stand users at his disposal.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Mboo asked.</p> <p>&quot;We make our way to Virginia. Clearly, yp6 wanted to stop us from getting to the Pentagon, so the information we need to find him must be there. If we can find a car, it should take us a couple of days at most.&quot; Theo explained to the group.</p> <p>&quot;This will be one of our most important and dangerous missions, and there's no doubt that yp6's men have already got information about the plane crash. We need to get going as soon as possible. Seeing as they managed to get into the Mi6, we can assume that they can infiltrate the Pentagon. We have to do this as fast as possible.&quot;</p> <p>Everyone solemnly nodded, as they realised the responsibility they held.</p> <p>&quot;I'll go look for a car then, or should we just start travelling East?&quot; Cipicao said.</p> <p>&quot;If there aren't any at this station, I think we should just start walking East,&quot; Shadow reasoned.</p> <p>Cipicao went to the station and searched around. It was clearly abandoned, and the meters had started to rust, but it was by no means ancient. He couldn't see any cars around the meters, so he assumed there weren't any.</p> <p>Upon further inspection, he saw that someone left an empty canister by the meter. He tested whether any fuel came out of the nozzle. He heard some pipes rattle and creak, and after a few moments, petrol started dripping.</p> <p>He put the canister under it, and it started filling up slowly.</p> <p>&quot;So which way is East?&quot; Pen asked Shadow.</p> <p>Shadow looked up at the sky, seeing the Sun casting its beams of light down on them. He shrugged. &quot;No clue,&quot; he said shortly. &quot;What about you, Theo?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Huh, what?&quot; Theo said distractedly. He clicked furiously on the laptop, before snapping it in half and crushing it.</p> <p>&quot;What are you doing? That was our only way of finding out which way was East since no one in a goddamn intelligence team has any intelligence!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You know that includes you as well right?&quot; Mboo replied.</p> <p>Pen opened his mouth angrily, then closed it. &quot;Well.. in any case, we're stuck here until one of us can find a way out.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It's fine Pen. We know the Moon rises in the East and the Sun sets in the West, so we can just wait until sunset. For now, let's check out the shop in the gas station. If we don't find a car soon this trip could really take a while,&quot; Theo explained.</p> <p>Cipicao came back holding the canister. &quot;There doesn't seem to be a car here, but I managed to find this canister and I filled it up with petrol.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Great, let's check the store, and then we'll stay here until sunset,&quot; Theo said, beckoning for the group to follow him.</p> <p>Theo entered the building, and they followed behind him. They each took different aisles, while Cipicao went behind the cash register, earning a dirty look from Mboo.</p> <p>&quot;What? Aren't we all basically stealing? What if there's no food, we'll still need money,&quot; he said defensively.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later, Theo gathered the group. &quot;So, luckily a lot of non-perishable food was left over, which means the food we found is actually edible. In terms of water, I think we'll need to wait until the next town or city we find. I wouldn't trust any water we found in this place anyway, to be honest. I hope no one's thirsty,&quot; he said with a smile.</p> <p>&quot;It looks like it's just about sunset, and the Sun's clearly over there, meaning that's West,&quot; he continued while pointing. &quot;Which means..&quot; he turned to face the opposite direction, still pointing, &quot;..that our destination is that way. Let's go!&quot;</p> <h2 id="chapter-6-the-plan"><a href="#chapter-6-the-plan" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 6 - The plan</h2> <p>A man sat on the roof of a building in Centralia, IL, looking bored.</p> <p>&quot;yp6 said they might be coming here, but I think that was a stupid guess. Why would they come here of all places,&quot; he complained to the air.</p> <p>Another man crouched behind him. &quot;Well, as long as I get to cause some trouble, I don't mind if they're here or not.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;So I have to work with you? Typical,&quot; the first man responded, catching a piece of gum the other threw at him before a piece of rock started to encase the gum. From inside, a muffled explosion could be heard. Just.</p> <p>/</p> <p>&quot;Ok, I know we just said we wanted to head East, but we need to decide our path to Washington, D.C. Once we find a town or a city, we'll find a map and plan our journey,&quot; Mboo said to the group.</p> <p>&quot;That plan includes us actually knowing where we are,&quot; Pen said resignedly.</p> <p>&quot;We kind of do,&quot; Theo replied. &quot;When I checked our location on the plane, I saw we were near Centralia. This road should take us at least near there.&quot;</p> <p>Right on cue, they could see a sign in the distance. Theo ran ahead to check what it said. After he read it, he gave a thumbs up to the rest of the group to indicate that they were on the right road.</p> <p>He waited there, and the rest caught up to him, and they continued walking. Shadow looked at the scenery, comparing it to the ones he saw back in England. There was a lot more to see here, almost like the sky was bigger. You could look into the distance and see it rain from miles away. You didn't get those views in the UK. Mostly cause it rained all the time anyway.</p> <p>After about half an hour, they could start seeing the outskirts of the town, and their spirits raised.</p> <p>&quot;Right, so to go over our plan. First, we get water, then we look for a car. We don't have any money, so we'll have to look for an abandoned one. Cipicao, you know how to service cars, right?&quot; Pen said, looking quite proud of his own responsibility.</p> <p>&quot;Yup, if we find a car, I can buy some cheap parts and we can get going,&quot; Cipicao replied. &quot;We have enough fuel to last a while, but we might need to take a stop, especially if the car isn't very efficient.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;While you're doing that, I'll find a map and plan our route to Virginia,&quot; Theo added.</p> <p>After a few minutes, they reached the edge of town and decided to split up there. Shadow went with Theo, and Mboo, Pen and Cipicao travelled together.</p> <p>Theo and Shadow went around the city, looking at the livelihood around it.</p> <p>&quot;You know, this is my first time in America,&quot; Shadow said to Theo.</p> <p>&quot;Well, I'm sorry it started with a plane crash,&quot; he responded with a laugh. &quot;How are you liking it?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It's different... but then there's stuff I recognise. I guess that's what big brands do. Go to any country and you'll find a McDonald's amongst all the culture. It's a bit frightening, but it's also a bit reassuring,&quot; Shadow said whilst shrugging.</p> <p>Theo thought to himself for a bit. &quot;I guess that makes sense. It's a small world in the end. Ah, that looks like a post office.&quot;</p> <p>In front of them was a small post office, with a pharmacy on one side and a barber's on the other.</p> <p>They entered and looked for a map.</p> <p>&quot;How big of a map do we want?&quot; Shadow asked while searching.</p> <p>&quot;Probably one that covers the whole of the US, or just the East. All we need are the roads, to be honest.&quot;</p> <p>After about a minute, they found the map section, and Shadow took one that seemed big enough and opened it up. Sure enough, it had the roads they needed. They paid for the map and sat down, planning their journey.</p> <p>&quot;I think our best path is to take interstate 64, here,&quot; Theo said while pointing. &quot;If we follow it far enough, it takes us almost directly South of D.C. It's also not too far from here, and it takes us through enough cities that we can restock on supplies if we need it.&quot;</p> <p>Shadow agreed, and they got up to leave when they saw something covering the doors and windows.</p> <p>&quot;Uh, shopkeep? Can you open the doors, we're still in here,&quot; Shadow called to the desk.</p> <p>The shopkeeper was confused and looked at the doors, saying he didn't press anything.</p> <p>Theo opened the door and felt the material that was covering the storefront. It was rough, like a rock. He looked back, to tell Shadow to feel it as well, but when he turned back, his hand had been encased by the rock!</p> <h2 id="chapter-7-how-to-escape-a-bedrock-wall"><a href="#chapter-7-how-to-escape-a-bedrock-wall" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 7 - How to escape a bedrock wall</h2> <p>Pen split up from Mboo and Cipicao to get water, while they looked for a car. He went to a high street and went into a clothes store. 'Things are always so much cheaper here,' he thought to himself, whilst feeling a soft cotton shirt.</p> <p>After a while, he went to the supermarket, and bought a six-pack of 1-litre water bottles, and stood outside the shop, waiting for Mboo and Cipicao to come back.</p> <p>He leaned back on the wall, picked up one of the bottles and started to drink from it. As he closed his eyes, he heard a large explosion from under him. He jumped back and watched the bag holding the bottles disintegrate, leaving behind a singular bottle.</p> <p>A voice emerged from behind him. &quot;Aww, I really thought that bottle was the one I made into a bomb.&quot; The voice leaned in. &quot;Hey Pen,&quot; it whispered.</p> <p>Pen spun around to face the voice. He saw a tall, slender man in his early twenties, a stand slightly emerging from his body.</p> <p>&quot;How did you like my stand, Killer Queen! It can turn any object it touches into a bomb. I played a game and tried to guess which water bottle you would choose. As you can probably tell, I got quite excited when I saw you pick up the pack I trapped,&quot; the man said. &quot;I'm Zepp by the way,&quot; he said whilst doing a heart sign with his fingers.</p> <p>&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Pen said before jumping back and bringing out his own stand. &quot;Mad World!&quot; A presence with abnormally long arms drifted out of Pen's body, and it assumed a fighting stance that mirrored Pen's.</p> <p>Pen lashed his hand out towards Zepp, but he dodged with unnerving speed, and within a few moments, he was behind Pen, kicking him in the back of the neck, sending him sprawling towards the ground, face first.</p> <p>Pen attempted to roll forward, and did so, but not without putting too much weight on his shoulder, leaving it sore.</p> <p>Zepp flicked a piece of chewing gum at Pen lazily, Pen dodging it instinctively. He heard an explosion behind him, and breathed a sigh of relief, happy that he had the reactions to dodge it.</p> <p>Pen stood up slowly, knowing the danger he was in. The enemy had a terrifying stand, as well as great physical agility and strength.</p> <p>/</p> <p>Theo called back to Shadow. &quot;Stay back, don't touch the walls!&quot;</p> <p>Shadow staggered back slightly, watching the rock grow around Theo's hand like a cancer, snaking up his arm slowly.</p> <p>Theo pulled back his other hand and punched into the wall, his strength magnified by his stand. The wall reverberated, sending ripples across the hard rock.</p> <p>Suddenly, they could hear a voice from outside. &quot;I'm afraid that's not going to work, this wall is pure bedrock, and the more I create, the harder it'll be to break. If you can't punch through this, you'll never break out! Have fun starving in there.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Who are you!&quot; Theo roared back, trying to place the source of the sound and punching where he thought it might be.</p> <p>&quot;Alright, if you really want to know, I guess there's no point keeping it a secret from you, seeing as you're going to die. I'm Shayne, and I'm one of yp6's men. You know, I didn't think you'd show up here at all, but I guess that man's cleverer than he loo-&quot;</p> <p>His monologue was interrupted by a fist thundering into his face, knocking him to the ground. &quot;What? Impossible, you couldn't have broken through, that wall was a metre thick!&quot; he ended in a shrill, panicking voice.</p> <p>He looked at the wall and saw a fist emerging through the bedrock, seemingly undisturbed by the metre of rock between them. He squinted closer, and saw that a body was walking through!</p> <p>&quot;It seems that your stand is able to create objects over time, which is how you encased us in this bedrock. We did spend a lot of time in this post office,&quot; a voice slowly said from inside the rock. &quot;Now isn't that convenient. When my stand touches an object with its fist, I can walk through it, and it changes its shape around me, almost like jelly.&quot; Shayne could now see a face through the rock, walking slowly in his direction. He starting crawling backwards on the ground, trying to make as much distance between him and them.</p> <p>Shadow finally stepped out of the rock. &quot;Now weren't you the perfect match for me.&quot; Shadow walked over to Shayne until he was standing directly over him.</p> <p>Against Shayne's pleas, he raised his fist, and brought it down against Shayne's face, thrusting his hand into his cheek, sending him sprawling across the ground, unconscious.</p> <p>Slowly, the rock around the shop started to crumble, and he could start to see the face of Theo through the window.</p> <p>After the rock fully dissipated, Theo stepped out slowly and looked at Shayne's ungraceful form on the ground.</p> <p>&quot;So, do we just.. leave him there?&quot; Shadow asked tentatively.</p> <p>&quot;No, of course not, but we do have to make sure he doesn't follow us on our journey. Let's just tie him up and put him somewhere quiet. Someone should find him in a few days, hopefully.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Let's get to the others. If we were attacked by a stand user then there's a high chance they were too.&quot;</p> <p>The pair ran to where they guessed the others might be, hoping that they were all ok.</p> <h2 id="chapter-8-explosion"><a href="#chapter-8-explosion" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 8 - Explosion</h2> <p>Pen looked the man in the eye, watching for any sudden movements. Even if Zepp was more agile, he still had good enough reflexes to dodge his attacks.</p> <p>Suddenly, he noticed that Zepp had completely relaxed, instead fiddling with a button near his collar. Pen was caught off guard and Zepp flicked the button towards him.</p> <p>Pen noticed just in time and made an upwards slicing motion, and his stand cut through the button.</p> <p>Zepp pressed an imaginary switch on his hands, and the button, now cut in half, exploded Pen from both sides, sending him backwards. He rolled across the ground, and Zepp walked calmly towards him.</p> <p>&quot;That's an interesting stand. You managed to slice the button with just its hands,&quot; Zepp said, seemingly impressed. &quot;However, it's slow. Too slow to fight me, a fit human. I've barely brought out my stand for this fight, and you've taken so many hits, and even an explosion. I commend your effort though,&quot; he said with a smile.</p> <p>&quot;You're right, it is slow,&quot; Pen said, coughing. &quot;But that's because it's not intended for fighting.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What's it intended for?&quot; Zepp said, raising an eyebrow.</p> <p>&quot;Take a look,&quot; Pen said with a weak smile, gesturing towards the wall next to them.</p> <p>Zepp looked at the wall Pen gestured to, and saw strange writing, written in something that looked horribly close to blood. &quot;Japanese?&quot; he said confusedly. &quot;On your file, it said the only languages you spoke were English and Russian.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;The file's right. Those are the only languages I speak,&quot; Pen replied confidently.</p> <p>&quot;So your stand can write in other languages? Well colour me impressed,&quot; Zepp said with a sneer. &quot;I'll translate for you, in case you forget what you wrote on your way to the afterlife.&quot;</p> <p>He turned to face the writing and started to translate the words slowly. &quot;You.. are already.. dead. You are already dead.&quot; He turned back towards Pen.</p> <p>&quot;Now that is a funny message, because you are in fact dead. I will ki-&quot;</p> <p>BOOM.</p> <p>Zepp's speech was cut off by a loud noise. He suddenly felt tired, so he went down to his knees. His stomach itched, so he scratched it. It still itched. He looked down to see why it itched.</p> <p>Oh, that's why it itched. It had a hole in it. Zepp put his hands to the hole in his stomach, and his hands got dirty with some thick liquid. Oh, it was blood. His stomach was bleeding. That's why it itched.</p> <p>Zepp wondered why it didn't hurt. In the movies, when someone had a hole in their stomach, they always looked like they were in pain. He wondered why there was a hole in his stomach. He looked around, in front of him, and he saw a little thing on the ground.</p> <p>He brought it up to his face to inspect it. It was a bullet. A bullet shot him through the stomach, so now he was bleeding. Now that he had solved the mystery, he could sleep.</p> <p>Zepp lied down on his front, eyes closed, and he bled to death peacefully.</p> <p>Pen looked for the source of the sound and saw two figures rushing towards him. He recognised them to be Cipicao and Mboo.</p> <p>&quot;Was that a stand user?&quot; Cipicao asked Pen.</p> <p>&quot;No, you shot a random civilian asking for the closest Applebee's,&quot; Pen replied sarcastically. &quot;Of course it was a stand user. Have you found a car?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;We managed to take one that looked fairly ok from a scrapyard, and Cipicao's going to work on it now. We don't know where the others are yet, so I think we should stay here while Cipicao tries to fix the car,&quot; Mboo answered.</p> <p>Cipicao went back to the site where the car was, putting the gun back into its holster.</p> <p>The remaining pair stood there, somewhat awkwardly, until something clicked in Pen's head.</p> <p>&quot;You want us to wait here, after there was a gunshot, <em>and</em> with a dead body next to us? You're actually a genius Mboo.&quot;</p> <p>Right on cue, they started to hear sirens in the distance, swiftly approaching. The pair ran around the corner, and into an alleyway, not daring to look back. They twisted and turned between the tall buildings, running away from the police. Occasionally, Pen would try to knock down walls behind them to throw the police off their trail. They ran out into an open space, where they saw Cipicao at a roadside, servicing a car.</p> <p>They ran across the road, and hid under the car for about a minute, before Cipicao leaned down and looked at them. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked, bemused.</p> <p>&quot;The police was chasing us, since, you know, you <em>shot</em> someone!&quot; Pen shouted, gasping for breath between words.</p> <p>Cipicao looked around comically. &quot;I don't hear a wee woo here. Are you sure you weren't imagining it?&quot; His joke earned a death stare from both Pen and Mboo, and he apologised.</p> <p>They sat around the car, bored, while Cipicao tinkered with it, every now and then turning on the engine, only to hear it eventually sputter.</p> <p>After a while, Theo and Shadow found the group squatted around the car. &quot;Were you attacked by a stand user?&quot; Theo asked.</p> <p>&quot;I was,&quot; Pen replied. &quot;Why? Were you attacked as well?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yeah, we were. This is bad, cause it means they know we're alive. No doubt the users who attacked us had already reported back to yp6,&quot; Theo reasoned to the group. &quot;We need to get to D.C as fast as possible, before he has time to gather the rest of his men.&quot;</p> <p>Shadow pulled out the map they bought and pointed towards a line in Illinois. &quot;This is the road we want to take: Interstate 64. It's a fairly straight road that takes us directly south of D.C. Can the car make that?&quot; he asked Cipicao.</p> <p>&quot;If nothing unexpected happens, it should last us the whole time,&quot; Cipicao replied.</p> <p>The group went to the South of town, and started to drive down to route 64, but not before getting more water. &quot;The user blew it up!&quot; Pen said in his defence after they asked why he failed the easiest job.</p> <h2 id="chapter-9-on-the-treetops"><a href="#chapter-9-on-the-treetops" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 9 - On the treetops</h2> <p>They spent many hours on the road to interstate 64, taking as few breaks as possible. They tried to fill up the fuel tank when it reached half, as they had no clue how accurate the car's meters were, or whether there would be an emergency on the way.</p> <p>Cipicao drove, with the rest arguing about who sat in the passenger seat. Usually, Theo won, leaving the others grumbling.</p> <p>On one of their short breaks at a gas station, they discussed where they would sleep.</p> <p>&quot;I think we should sleep in a quiet place, rather than a city. It's too easy for someone to track us in a city, so spending as little time there would be best,&quot; Theo said to Cipicao.</p> <p>&quot;In that case, we have the choices of here, or here,&quot; Cipicao said, pointing to two patches of green that the interstate intersected. They're many hours apart, so it would have to be one or the other. I think, since we need to be as fast as possible, we should go to this one, in Northern Kentucky.&quot;</p> <p>Theo nodded in agreement. &quot;That seems like the best option for us, but are you sure you can drive the whole way? One of us can take over while you rest. We need to be alert, and one uncomfortable night after essentially a day of driving won't be enough.&quot;</p> <p>Cipicao conceded, and let Theo drive the rest of the way to the forest.</p> <p>They drove for a few more hours, Cipicao snoring in the back while Pen complained loudly. They didn't take any more stops, instead opting to go directly to the forest and get rest there.</p> <p>They parked the car at the side of the road and walked down into the woods.</p> <p>&quot;We should choose a place somewhat close to the car, but still far enough that we'll be left alone,&quot; Mboo reasoned to the group.</p> <p>They walked out about a kilometre, where the trees seemed quite dense, and started to set up a small camp. While they didn't have camping gear, they managed to make a makeshift tent propped up against a tree and covered it with leaves so if it rained they wouldn't get wet.</p> <p>A few used their coats to lie on, while Pen absolutely refused to put his head anywhere near the dirt. He decided to sit up against the wall and sleep, which hurt his neck. However, he never admitted this to the group, and eventually fell asleep, his neck aching massively.</p> <p>&quot;I'll keep watch for the first few hours,&quot; Mboo said. &quot;And I'll wake Shadow up in three? Does that sound good?&quot;</p> <p>Shadow nodded. &quot;Then I'll wake up Pen and after his shift, it'll be morning and we'll go.&quot;</p> <p>The group fell asleep, leaving Mboo staring into the darkness.</p> <p>She fidgeted with a stick on the ground, looking bored, when she was launched across the ground!</p> <p>The flew for a few metres, before hitting the ground, skidding into a tree. She reorientated herself and looked out into the darkness. She turned her head, looking left, looking right, but she couldn't see a thing.</p> <p>&quot;Up here!&quot; a voice called teasingly.</p> <p>Mboo looked up for the source of the voice and saw a silhouette sitting on a tree branch, relaxed.</p> <p>Mboo took a couple steps back and fell her back. There was an impact on her back, which was what sent her flying earlier. She credited it to the person above her now, who was quite clearly a stand user.</p> <p>&quot;Who are you!&quot; she called up into the darkness.</p> <p>&quot;My name's Michael, and I'm going to kill all of you with my stand, Fairies Wear Boots. I'll start with you,&quot; he said with a smile.</p> <p>He jumped off the branch and leapt towards Mboo at a staggering speed, such that Mboo barely had the time to move out of the way. Michael caught her on the shoulder with his leg and brought her down to the floor.</p> <p>Suddenly, Michael felt a force push him away from Mboo, and he was thrown backwards. He landed on his feet gracefully and watched Mboo get up.</p> <p>&quot;It seems your stand can manipulate the space around you, but it doesn't look like its range is that large. It sounds strong on paper, but since it requires your reactions to work effectively, it's weak against a stand like mine, where I can close ground between us before you even realise it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You're absolutely right,&quot; Mboo said, staring at Michael to see any sudden movements. &quot;My stand, Bullets with Butterfly Wings. allows me to control the space around me. I can also alter the physical properties of objects.&quot;</p> <p>She picked up a small stick and threw it at Michael, its speed augmented by her stand.</p> <p>Michael just watched the tiny stick hurtle towards him, ready to lazily kick it away with his stand's powerful legs. However, as it reached around 10 metres away from her, it quickly grew into a massive fallen branch, hurtling at the same speed as before, seemingly unaffected by gravity.</p> <p>Michael just barely noticed in time and tried to jump up to a higher branch. However, the branch was too quick, and it crashed into what was, by comparison, the flimsy twig Michael was standing on.</p> <p>As Michael started to jump, the two branches collided, and the one he was on started to creak downwards, throwing his jump off balance. He jumped off, landing on the floor badly, hurting his arm.</p> <p>Michael jumped back into the trees, hiding in the darkness, and Mboo looked around, prepared for another attack. Unfortunately, the attack came at her back once more, and she felt a kick in the centre of her spine, knocking her to the ground. She used her stand to slow her fall, but it could do nothing about the searing pain in her back.</p> <p>She opened her mouth to shout for the others to wake up, but was cut off by Michael.</p> <p>&quot;Don't even think about calling for them. The moment you do, I'll jump over there and snap their necks before you even realise. I said I'll kill you one by one, and that's what I'll do!&quot;</p> <p>Mboo looked up for the source of the sound, but all she could see was the darkness of the forest. Michael was moving too fast for her to react.</p> <h2 id="chapter-10-shimmering-in-the-moonlight"><a href="#chapter-10-shimmering-in-the-moonlight" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 10 - Shimmering in the Moonlight</h2> <p>Mboo backed up against a tree. She had no idea how to defeat someone like Michael in a dark forest. His stand let him jump to incredible heights at a breathtaking speed. A forest was his ideal location to fight.</p> <p>She started to run, boosting her steps with her stand, going at a speed almost matching Michael's.</p> <p>Michael chased after her, taunting her as he leapt from tree to tree. &quot;Running now? I can chase you forever, running won't save you or your friends!&quot;</p> <p>He sprung down at attack Mboo, and she just barely dodged, instead getting tripped up. She took an ungraceful roll and propelled herself up using her stand, continuing her sprint.</p> <p>Finally, she ran into what she was looking for, a clearing! She dashed into the open space and looked back at Michael.</p> <p>He was leaning on a tree, his face barely visible in the deep moonlight. &quot;You seem to think that I'd be stupid enough to follow you there,&quot; he called out. &quot;But what you haven't realised is that you've lost! You're separated from your sleeping friends, and I can reach them faster than you!</p> <p>He jumped away and disappeared into the darkness.</p> <p>Mboo chased after him, using her augmented steps to increase her speed again.</p> <p>However, when she reached the edge of the clearing, a shadow bolted down over her.</p> <p>Instantly, she threw herself sideways, and there was a crash next to her. She looked at what caused the impact and saw Michael clutching at his foot, clearly having broken it.</p> <p>She used her stand to force him onto the ground and approached him.</p> <p>&quot;H-how did you know that I stayed here? That couldn't have been reactionary, that attack was instantaneous,&quot; Michael asked, groaning in pain.</p> <p>Mboo shrugged. &quot;I just had a feeling you wouldn't miss an opportunity to get a hit on me when I least expected it,&quot; she said before pulling her fist back.</p> <p>She punched him in the face until he was knocked out, giving him an ugly bruise on his cheek, then dragged him back to the makeshift tent, where Pen was awake.</p> <p>&quot;Who's that?&quot; he asked, watching Mboo pull a body carelessly.</p> <p>&quot;Another stand user,&quot; she replied, grunting with each pull. &quot;Can you wake the others up, we need to go now if they already know we're here.&quot;</p> <p>They woke the others up and explained the situation. Theo agreed that they should drive as soon as possible.</p> <p>&quot;What do we do with him?&quot; Shadow asked.</p> <p>Theo turned to Cipicao, who nodded. He wrote a note, put twenty hundred dollar notes in it and left it on Michael's face.</p> <p>&quot;What will giving him that much money do?&quot; Shadow said, confused.</p> <p>&quot;When I give someone a significant amount of money, I can control their actions using my stand,&quot; Cipicao explained.</p> <p>&quot;What did you make him do?&quot; Shadow inquired.</p> <p>&quot;Make him write 'Ugga' on the tree,&quot; he said shortly.</p> <p>Shadow was clearly puzzled. &quot;Why?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;For fun?&quot; he said while shrugging.</p> <p>&quot;Anything else?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Oh yeah, I made him never chase us again.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Shadow said. &quot;Isn't that what you should've said first? Also, why don't we make him tell us where yp6 is?&quot;</p> <p>Cipicao nodded, and turned to write more on the paper, before deciding against it. &quot;yp6 wouldn't be stupid enough to tell his grunts all of his details. He is a worldwide terrorist after all. What we need to do right now is get out of here.&quot;</p> <p>They returned to the car, Pen driving, smug that he finally had a seat to himself.</p> <p>They drove for many hours, until it was past the afternoon.</p> <p>&quot;We want to get off this route soon, and transfer to interstate 79, but we'll still need a break before we reach Virginia. It'll be night very soon,&quot; Theo said to the group.</p> <p>&quot;Wait, if we're transferring roads soon, does that mean we're in West Virginia now?&quot; Pen asked Theo.</p> <p>&quot;Yeah, we are. Why?&quot;</p> <p>Instantly, Pen started singing at full volume.</p> <p>&quot;COUNTRY ROADS, TAKE ME HOME</p> <p>TO THE PLACE I BELONG</p> <p>WEST VIRGINIA, MOUNTAIN MAMA</p> <p>TAKE ME HOME, COUNTRY ROADS&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Shut up Pen!&quot; Mboo shouted over the thunderous, mis-pitched roars that Pen was emitting from his mouth. She forced his mouth shut using her stand, but to no avail, as Pen just started humming as loudly as possible, irritating everyone with the buzz that was stemming from his throat.</p> <p>Shadow looked at the map. &quot;Do we want to stop at Charleston first, or just keep going?&quot; he asked Theo.</p> <p>&quot;I really don't want to stop. It seemed like yp6 just knows our trajectory and he'll place another stand user there to intercept us,&quot; Theo said, his voice unsure.</p> <p>&quot;I think we should keep going, and just switch over drivers. If we need gas, we'll just stop at an empty-ish station,&quot; Cipicao interjected.</p> <p>Everyone agreed, and they decided to skip through Charleston, instead driving through the night, taking turns driving. Early in the morning the next day, while Cipicao was driving, the saw that they had crossed the Virginia border, and were now extremely close to their destination.</p> <p>They switched roads again and started to drive towards D.C, wondering whether yp6 or his men were there yet.</p> <h2 id="chapter-11-entrance"><a href="#chapter-11-entrance" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 11 - Entrance</h2> <p>After a couple hours, they finally arrived at Washington D.C! They drove to Arlington and parked the car near the Pentagon, glad that the first step of their journey was over.</p> <p>They walked to the Pentagon and were stopped at the gate.</p> <p>&quot;ID?&quot; a guard asked.</p> <p>&quot;We don't have any, we're with the Mi6 to discuss confidential matters,&quot; Theo replied.</p> <p>&quot;Can't get in without an ID,&quot; the guard said shortly.</p> <p>Cipicao stepped forward, holding out some money secretly. &quot;Not even for a tip?&quot;</p> <p>The guard looked at the money, and back at Cipicao. &quot;Get out of my sight,&quot; he said to them, shooing them away with the butt of his gun he was holding.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Now, now. Let's not get hasty here,&quot; a voice said, appearing from next to them.</p> <p>The guard turned and saluted. &quot;Mr President, sir! Where are your bodyguards?&quot;</p> <p>The man who appeared before them laughed it off. &quot;That doesn't matter now. Can you please let these fine gentlemen-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;And woman!&quot; Mboo interjected.</p> <p>&quot;And gentlewoman,&quot; he agreed. &quot;..onto the premises. They have my explicit permission.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Of course sir!&quot; the man said before allowing the group in, the president following them.</p> <p>&quot;So you're the president, OGBubby?&quot; Theo asked.</p> <p>&quot;The one and only,&quot; he said cordially.</p> <p>&quot;Why did you let us in personally?&quot; Theo said, instantly flipping the atmosphere into a serious one.</p> <p>&quot;If I hadn't, what would you have done?&quot; he replied coolly. &quot;Ah, here's our stop. Do you want to come to KFC with me? They have a nice one in this place. No? What about Taco Bell?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;We'd rather get this over with as soon as possible, but thanks for the offer,&quot; Theo said.</p> <p>Bubby looked downtrodden, but then perked right up again. &quot;Not everyone has to go then! You and one other person can go, and the rest of us can eat.&quot;</p> <p>Theo took a look at his group, tired and hungry from the direct travel they did over a third of America's width, and gave in.</p> <p>&quot;Ok then, Pen, Shadow and Mboo, you can go with the president, and I'll complete our first task with Cipicao,&quot; Theo said, leaving everyone happy.</p> <p>&quot;So, Taco Bell or KFC?&quot;</p> <p>There were two cries of KFC, and one of Taco Bell, and Shadow and Mboo stared at Pen.</p> <p>&quot;Really, you'd go to Taco Bell over KFC?&quot; Mboo asked incredulously.</p> <p>&quot;KFC's fries are really inconsistent!&quot; he said in defence.</p> <p>They went to KFC, Bubby paying for the whole meal as thanks for their service.</p> <p>Pen got a burger, Mboo got fries and Shadow got a wrap. They waited about 15 minutes, Pen loudly complaining after the first, saying that it's not fast food if it takes ages.</p> <p>Finally, after a wait that was only excruciating because of Pen's moaning, their food arrived.</p> <p>&quot;Why are there carrots?&quot; Shadow asked. &quot;We didn't order any, did we?&quot;</p> <p>He picked up the bag to take it to the counter when something pierced into his shoulder!</p> <p>He jumped back, alerting the others, and felt his wound. He didn't feel anything. He looked around to see what had pierced him, but the only thing he could see was a massive hole in the KFC bag.</p> <p>&quot;Everyone, throw away your bags!&quot; he cried to the group.</p> <p>Despite barely understanding the situation, they threw their bags towards the centre of the room, watching some orange thing burst out of the bags momentarily. All of them, except Bubby. Even if he was president, he didn't have the reactions or the trust the others did. The disappearing object struck a deep hole into his stomach.</p> <p>Instantly, panic overcame the room, as people saw the president be stabbed inexplicably next to a group of suspicious foreigners.</p> <p>They ran out, trampling and knocking each other over.</p> <p>Shadow tried to stop them, but it was too late.</p> <p>The object grew again, and Shadow finally saw what it was. The carrots that were in the bag were growing and shrinking almost instantaneously, leaving a minuscule trace behind.</p> <p>The multiple carrots on the floor engorged and pierced the crowd, skewering them like a morbid shish kebab, before disappearing once more, leaving insides strewn across the walls and floor.</p> <p>The group got against the wall, Shadow attempting to stop Bubby's bleeding, but to no avail. The killer, this stand user, was clever. By removing the carrots instantly, blood freely flows, making it impossible to counter, especially at a size this large.</p> <p>Pen brought out his stand, stabbing at the scrunched paper boxes that held the lethal carrots with its abnormally long arms. It tore open, and there were no carrots inside!</p> <p>Suddenly, a massive orange spike erupted from the wall next to him, ripping open his shirt, slicing his shoulder and throwing him to the ground. He rolled over, barely conscious, until he was under a person sitting calmly at a table.</p> <p>Pen's eyes widened in realisation, but the man lifted his foot up and brought it down, stamping him on the face until he was knocked out.</p> <h2 id="chapter-12-xenophobia"><a href="#chapter-12-xenophobia" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 12 - Xenophobia</h2> <p>In the midst of the chaos, Mboo saw Pen roll across the floor, before having her leg be punctured by another carrot. She kneeled to the floor, grabbing at the wound.</p> <p>She looked towards where Pen had rolled to and saw someone sitting at a table calmly, looking at them smugly.</p> <p>Mboo used her stand, detaching a table and throwing it towards the man, but it was futile. He simply formed a carrot from the wall, piercing into the table and giving him a shield between them.</p> <p>She started to dash across the room, dodging the massive amount of carrots attacking her. She was just in front of the table she just threw, knowing the man that did this was on the other side.</p> <p>As she looked into the table, planning what to do next, a carrot started emerging from it, right between her eyes!</p> <p>Using her stand, she threw her head back until she was in some sort of limbo position, dodging the carrot erupting from the wooden table.</p> <p>She twisted to its side, and she caught a glimpse of the man, still smiling endlessly.</p> <p>At this point, Shadow was attempting to take the president out of the shop, away from the danger, as carrots grew from the walls, slashing his legs as he dragged Bubby's limp body.</p> <p>He staggered out of the shop, and let Bubby loose on the ground when another, gigantic carrot started to grow!</p> <p>It threw him upwards, and he grabbed its side, barely being able to cling onto it as is thrust into the sky. He had to do something now, or he would be too high up to think properly.</p> <p>He punched the carrot and started phasing through it slowly, as if he were swimming through oil. He poked his head out to see what was happening and saw a crowd forming around the president, a few people making calls on their phone frantically.</p> <p>One of them noticed Shadow and started pointing and screaming. He realised regular people couldn't see stands. He wondered what he looked like to them, a floating man or a disembodied head. It didn't seem like they noticed the massive carrots, so he guessed that he was simply a head.</p> <p>Regardless, he needed to get back into the shop. Bubby was now relatively safe, but that still left Pen and Mboo inside the shop. He started making a swimming motion, pulling himself further downwards through the carrot until he reached the bottom.</p> <p>He stepped out and sprinted back to the shop, watching Mboo be kicked back by a leg, the rest of its body obscured by a table. She cushioned her impact into the wall with her stand, and Shadow rushed to the table. He assumed the stand user was behind it, and punched through it, its shape being remoulded around it. He felt something sharp and retracted his hand instantly.</p> <p>He opened his fist and saw a hole going through one of his fingers and the centre of his palm. He screamed in pain, clutching at his hand, now pouring blood that he couldn't stop.</p> <p>Like a hawk that just found its prey, a carrot grew towards the source of the sound. In his panic, Shadow punched at the carrot to block it, but his hand went through it!</p> <p>It was going straight for his brain.</p> <p>He closed his eyes, ready for his death, but he just felt something go through him. He forgot that by punching it like that, his entire body became permeable to it.</p> <p>He cursed his panic, and punched the table physically, breaking it down punch by punch, until he could finally see the man, still unbothered by what was happening around him.</p> <p>The man created a carrot from the remains of the table, smashing through the wall behind him, and he stepped out into the open space calmly, before breaking into a slow jog.</p> <p>Shadow chased after him, Mboo staying behind to take care of Pen. He left the building, but stopped straight away, his spirits falling.</p> <p>A massive crowd had formed, looking into the destruction at the KFC, as well as taking pictures of the president, now being hushed away into a private ambulance.</p> <p>From somewhere in the crowd, he heard a cry. &quot;There, that's the one who stabbed him!&quot;</p> <p>He looked to the source, to see where the person may be indicating to, and saw a woman pointing directly towards him.</p> <p>He was confused, and before he noticed, he had a gun held against the back of his head, and cuffs were being clamped onto his wrists.</p> <p>&quot;W-what?&quot; he started to say, but was poked in the back of the head with a gun, the guard telling him to be quiet.</p> <p>&quot;I'm not the murderer, he's in the crowd!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;We're just arresting suspects, and you're really suspicious,&quot; the guard said gruffly, clearly absolutely sure that Shadow was the murderer.</p> <p>In the crowd that was now forming around him, jeers and boos so loud they weren't even letting him think, he saw someone smiling cruelling at him before disappearing again.</p> <p>Shadow brought out his stand, punched the cuffs so they fell through his hands and punched both the guard in an instant, running into the crowd, who parted like the red sea as they thought a murderer chased after him.</p> <p>As if to frame Shadow even more, massive spikes started coming out of the ground, stabbing the many people, throwing them into the air, dropping again like flies.</p> <p>Shadow came to a stop and looked around, eyes darting from person to person, but he was unable to find the man.</p> <p>An impossible thought came to his mind, but he had to try it.</p> <p>He punched the concrete under him until he started to sink into the ground, and undid the effect, removing his permeability.</p> <p>He was flung up, the universe not allowing him to stay in a wall. In the air, he scanned the people's faces like he was counting flowers in a quadrat, until he found the most terrified face of all.</p> <p>His stand pushed him forward, sending him flying to the man who was now attempting to run away in fright, but it was useless.</p> <p>Shadow was darting towards him. The moment he got close enough, he brought out his stand once more, legs first, crushing through the man.</p> <p>He was sprayed with blood, as when he looked behind, the force of the impact was so great, it had utterly destroyed his abdomen, leaving barely attached legs and an upper third of his body.</p> <p>By this point, police were arriving, trying to assess the situation. Shadow commended their bravery, but still cursed at their appearance. He used his stand to punch a wall, and walked through it, entering one of the rooms ground floor of the Pentagon, reasoning that they'd expect the killer to be somewhere in the vicinity.</p> <p>He hoped that Pen and Mboo were ok. He also wondered where Theo and Cipicao were.</p> <h2 id="chapter-13-labour-for-the-truth"><a href="#chapter-13-labour-for-the-truth" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 13 - Labour for the Truth</h2> <p>After OGBubby led Pen, Mboo and Shadow into KFC, a guard escorted Theo and Cipicao into the main building, where they would finally get the information they needed.</p> <p>They were allowed into an elevator, which went down to somewhere deep underground. Theo looked at the engraved pattern on the mirror, watching the lines snake across the glass. He spaced out until they finally reached their floor. They exited into a small foyer that led to two corridors.</p> <p>They followed the guard, who took them to the corridor on the left and led them into a door. He stepped aside and allowed them in, where they saw a small team at a computer.</p> <p>They walked in and greeted the people. &quot;So, what information are we actually looking for?&quot; Cipicao asked.</p> <p>&quot;Large purchases of land and videography equipment,&quot; he answered, indicating to the group that they should search for that.</p> <p>&quot;The desperation with which he's sent stand users against us makes me think that he didn't think to use a fake name, and the result we'll get is real,&quot; Theo whispered to Cipicao.</p> <p>They saw one person typing into a keyboard, before nodding to them, inviting them to see.</p> <p>They saw some sort of searching, with an ETA of when it would be completed.</p> <p>&quot;This should finish in about 3 minutes, and then you'll be done,&quot; the man said.</p> <p>Cipicao thanked him, and the pair leaned back against the wall, sitting bored.</p> <p>Theo dozed off, exhausted from the days driving and fighting stand users, glad that it was almost going to be over.</p> <p>His dreams were marred by a constant noise. After a few moments, he gained lucidity and realised that the noises were coming from outside.</p> <p>He pulled himself out of the dream, expecting the search to be done.</p> <p>However, what he instead saw were people dropping like flies, a presence appearing next to them, slitting their throats, then phasing out of existence, only to appear next to another to repeat the act.</p> <p>Theo stood up instantly, grabbing Cipicao by the collar and dragging him back to the door, looking back. Everyone was now lying on the floor.</p> <p>Cipicao was now somewhat awake, standing by himself and trying to comprehend the situation.</p> <p>Theo pulled the door handle, but the door was closed. He looked for a lock and saw one that could only be opened by a keycard. He cursed technology and brought out his stand to punch the door when he saw a shadow lurking over Cipicao.</p> <p>He pulled down Cipicao by the shirt and punched where his torso was, but there was no connection. He looked around, but the man was nowhere to be seen. He felt a presence behind him and felt something pierce his back.</p> <p>He fell to his knees and spun his head, still not receiving any answer to the murderer's absence.</p> <p>Frustrated, he punched through the door, breaking it down while enduring the pain in his back.</p> <p>Cipicao had his pistol out, aiming into the darkness, also unable to find the murderer's position.</p> <p>Cipicao took money out of his blazer pocket warily, staring outwards for any hint of an attack.</p> <p>&quot;If you take this money, will you take us to yp6?&quot; he called out.</p> <p>In response, a cut slashed across his forearm.</p> <p>Cipicao fell to the ground, clutching his arm. He was dragged across the floor by Theo, who took them out of the room.</p> <p>As Theo entered the corridor and he saw what lay in front of him, only one thing could escape his lips.</p> <p>&quot;Oh, my god.&quot;</p> <p>Bodies lay all across the ground. The man who was attacking them, piece by piece, had exterminated everyone in the building. They probably weren't even part of the contract.</p> <p>Theo remembered a story he heard as a child, about an assassin. Very few people believed that he existed, but it was a chilling story nonetheless. This man was able to wipe out whole rooms. Over his whole career, only one man had ever survived, entirely out of luck. He was interrogated by many organisations, but he answered them all with the same answer: they dropped one by one, but there was no murderer that he could see.</p> <p>After he stopped being a person of interest, he was found dead in the street with no trace of the killer.</p> <p>The assassin was named Dim, in respect and fear of his ability to hide in plain sight.</p> <p>Once he completed this thought, he realised that Dim had stopped attacking them, seemingly because they were out in the corridor.</p> <p>He realised that he must be destroying the computer that had yp6's details in, and he sprinted through the doorway.</p> <p>A little glint caught his eye, and he ducked backwards, a blade slashing centimetres over his eyes.</p> <p>He thought he saw a gloved hand holding the knife, and he smiled. It seemed the killer could not attack while he was invisible.</p> <p>Theo brought his stand out and punched where he thought the source of the knife was, but there was no connection.</p> <p>There was no way he could move that fast, even if he was invisible. Theo had to figure out how his stand worked if he wanted even a chance to defeat him.</p> <h2 id="chapter-14-marriage-between-life-and-death"><a href="#chapter-14-marriage-between-life-and-death" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 14 - Marriage Between Life and Death</h2> <p>Theo jumped back into the corridor, watching the room he was just attacked in. For some reason, Dim had not left that room. He had to figure out how Dim's stand worked or he would have no chance of defeating it.</p> <p>As if to confuse Theo further, he heard a cry from behind him and saw Cipicao's shin get slashed. Theo now saw their attacker in his full glory. He wore a ninja-style suit that absorbed light perfectly, as if he was a hole in reality.</p> <p>Cipicao jumped towards Theo with his working leg, and Theo punched towards Dim. This time, Dim didn't disappear into thin air, instead spinning to the side, as elegant as a ballerina, but no less terrifying.</p> <p>Cipicao fired a shot towards Dim, who barely slid out of the way. It grazed his leg, and blood slowly flowed to the floor.</p> <p>Theo's eyes widened. Now that Dim was leaving a blood trail, Theo could track his movements, even when he was invisible.</p> <p>Dim produced a very large cloth and covered himself with it, slowly walking towards the door. Only the top of his hand was visible.</p> <p>Cipicao, not allowing himself to be unnerved, shot into the cloth, right in the centre. However, there was no hit. There was only a minuscule hole in the cloth.</p> <p>Frustrated, Cipicao shot multiple times, each bullet penetrating the sheet. There was no connection.</p> <p>Now he was angry. He gave up on trying to hit a vital and instead aimed for the only body part he could see.</p> <p>Slowly, he aimed. He steadied his fingers and his breathing. He pulled the trigger, as calm as one could be in this situation.</p> <p>The bullet forced its way through Dim's hand and he dropped the cloth, revealing his entire body, untouched by the previous bullets. There was no blood trail on the floor whatsoever.</p> <p>Theo shot forward and punched towards Dim, but it was too late. Dim was inside the room and disappeared.</p> <p>Theo jumped back preemptively and a knife slashed right in front of his face.</p> <p>What was different? Why did Dim use a cloth outside? Why didn't he just disappear? Why can he do it now?</p> <p>It couldn't be because he was in an open space. That would be stupid. What other differences were there?!</p> <p>Theo looked up into the light and watched it pour into the hallway, contrasting the many dimly lit, crooked corners of the room Dim was hiding in.</p> <p>Something clicked in his brain.
&quot;Cipicao, bring out a torch!&quot; he said.</p> <p>Cipicao was confused, but he did so anyway.</p> <p>&quot;Shine it into that room,&quot; Theo instructed.</p> <p>A voice from inside the room croaked. &quot;Very well done, you've uncovered at least some part of how my stand, The Invisible Man, works. But can you defeat it, I wonder...&quot;</p> <p>As if you had just turned a game from its lowest difficulty to its highest, Dim spun out of the room, holding multiple cloths.</p> <p>He threw them into the air, some covering him, some going nowhere.</p> <p>&quot;I knew you would do that again!&quot; Theo cried, and he used his stand to punch each cloth that came near him down, leaving only two.</p> <p>He rushed into the cloths and pulled them down, punching instantaneously, but Dim was not there.</p> <p>&quot;What, but there are no shadows, how can he not be here?&quot; he murmured to himself.</p> <p>&quot;Good plan, but I'm afraid you were too closed-minded,&quot; a voice said from above.</p> <p>Theo looked up and saw Dim lying on one of the metal poles that suspended the lights, playing around with a knife. It seemed that one of the cloths he had thrown upwards was intended to land on one of the poles.</p> <p>&quot;Shoot him Cipicao! It doesn't matter if you break one light, just get him before he breaks them all!&quot;</p> <p>Cipicao shot his pistol upwards, but his aim was skewered by the fact that he was essentially aiming to into a light as blinding as the sun on a midsummer's day.</p> <p>He fired some more shots and hit the light, enveloping a large portion of the room in darkness.</p> <p>Inexplicably, Dim disappeared, then reappeared at the next light, with no indication of how he travelled there.</p> <p>This time, Theo launched himself up and punched towards Dim, who simply leaned back, casually dodging.</p> <p>Theo caught himself on the bar and flipped himself over, now on the pole with Dim.</p> <p>He rushed forward to attack, Dim now taking this battle seriously.</p> <p>He threw a punch that Dim ducked, who then spun around, a knife in his hand.</p> <p>Theo wouldn't let himself be cut again, and punched Dim in the back, launching him off the pole.</p> <p>Despite being thrown by Theo's destructive punch, Dim started to laugh.</p> <p>Theo looked down to see why Dim could possibly be laughing, and the face of anger on Theo's face turned to shock.</p> <p>Dim was crouching on Cipicao's chest, who now lay on the ground, a knife in his chest.</p> <p>&quot;You pushed me into him!&quot; Dim shouted in glee. &quot;The knife I held went into his chest like a magnet!&quot; Dim just kept laughing from the bottom of his abyss of a heart.</p> <p>Theo was furious.</p> <p>He propelled himself off the pole and threw a punch, but Dim would not allow himself to be careless just because he could find enjoyment in one of his kills.</p> <p>Theo just kept punching, one by one. His stand's muscles looked as if they were about to pop just from the rage Theo felt.</p> <p>Every single punch Theo threw, Dim dodged with ease. He was too athletic, and then he had his stand ability as well.</p> <p>Theo couldn't let Dim back into the shade, or the fight would be over.</p> <h2 id="chapter-15-and-then-there-were-four"><a href="#chapter-15-and-then-there-were-four" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 15 - And then there were Four</h2> <p>Theo managed to position himself between the room containing yp6's information and Dim, who still stood on Cipicao's body, insulting his memory.</p> <p>No matter what rage Theo felt right now,  he could not lose his composure. He was fighting against an assassin who had decades of experience.</p> <p>Theo thought about the true goal of their arrival in D.C: to find out yp6's identity. He knew that whatever showed up on that screen would be enough to track him down.</p> <p>He started to turn in order to find out whether he could see it from his current location, but it seemed that Dim was planning for that. He shot forward, a knife, almost invisible, in his hand.</p> <p>Theo caught the knife between his hands, inches away from his chest. The two pushed against the knife, until it shattered, one of its shards slicing the side of Dim's neck.</p> <p>Theo, seeing an advantage, grabbed a shard of the knife out of the air with extreme precision and stuck it into Dim's stomach and then hit him in the face with a left hook a boxer would envy.</p> <p>Dim flew for metres before hitting the wall with a massive impact.</p> <p>He opened his eyes groggily and saw Theo rushing towards him, a fist pulled back.</p> <p>He pushed back against the wall with his head and slid down, lying flat on his back as Theo punched into the wall with his stand.</p> <p>Dim kicked one of his legs upwards, hitting Theo in the groin before he could punch once more, then dug his shoes into Theo's tailbone, pushing himself out from under Theo whilst also hurting him massively.</p> <p>Dim brandished another knife, and Theo took another fighting stance, sharp pains all across his body.</p> <p>Theo walked slowly towards Dim when he disappeared. Theo realised Dim was now in shade and he jumped back, a knife cutting his shirt cleanly.</p> <p>Theo looked around and saw that he was now in the room they first entered to find yp6's details.</p> <p>He took a deep breath, trying to remember what the true objective of this mission was, regardless of how many team members he lost.</p> <p>He stood still, fists up and calmed his breathing, feeling the adrenaline course through his body. Dim would be getting ready to attack him soon.</p> <p>Even though there was no possible indication that Dim would attack, Theo still felt it coming. He punched upwards, feeling contact with Dim's face.</p> <p>Dim flew upwards and hit the ceiling.</p> <p>Theo unleashed a massive punching barrage, hitting every inch of Dim, who was slowly losing consciousness.</p> <p>Theo continued, letting out all the anger he felt for Cipicao's death onto Dim.</p> <p>Suddenly, Dim disappeared, and Theo's heart skipped a beat. He hopped back, waiting for an attack, but none came. He took a light an shined it where he was attacking Dim, and saw him lying on the ground mangled.</p> <p>Theo let out a sigh and almost dropped to the ground from the guilty sense of relief that flowed through him.</p> <p>He went to the computer and looked at the screen and his heart fell twenty stories.</p> <p>The computer had frozen at 72%, and he had no idea how to get it going again.</p> <p>He kicked the desk out of anger and the computer's fans started whirring loudly. His heart skipped a beat. He must have broken the computer and now there was no chance of it ever working.</p> <p>He sank into the chair, devastated. It felt worse because he knew yp6 would have shown up on the screen that was in front of him.</p> <p>After endless moments of despair, he got up and went to the door, when he saw something in a mirror.</p> <p>The percentage bar was showing how much a paper had been printed!</p> <p>Theo ran to the printer next to the still frozen computer and looked at the paper. About half of it was visible. He started to tug at it, but it wouldn't budge.</p> <p>He let go before he tore the paper and thought about what to do.</p> <p>After a couple seconds, he brought his hands into the printer like a reverse vice and tore it open, leaving the paper barely hanging to the dissected machine.</p> <p>He carefully took it out, and he scanned the page with his eyes, looking for the information he needed.</p> <p>He saw a name, and his entire body relaxed.</p> <p>'Marcus Kvalheim'</p> <p>That was the person they were looking for.</p> <p>There also seemed to be the top of a picture of his face, but it hadn't printed fully.</p> <p>Theo wasn't too bothered about this, as now he had a name and.. he scanned the page again.. he also had an address.</p> <p>He looked more into it and saw that yp6 was born in Norway, but moved to America when he was very young, his family settling in Florida.</p> <p>He seemed to like holidays to the Middle East, going multiple times a year, as often as possible.</p> <p>Theo stood up, paper in hand, rejuvenated with the information he now knew and walked out the door.</p> <p>He instantly deflated. Not only did he fall asleep, allowing Dim to kill everyone that now lay around him, but he also let Cipicao die because he was careless.</p> <p>He walked to the elevator stiffly, eyes forward, avoiding the accusing eyes of the dead, asking why they weren't saved.</p> <p>He closed his fist around the paper tightly, until his palm started to bleed from the holes his nails dug.</p> <p>The elevator door closed around him and he promised he wouldn't let any more of his team members die.</p> <h2 id="chapter-16-out-of-the-abyss"><a href="#chapter-16-out-of-the-abyss" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 16 - Out of the Abyss</h2> <p>The doors of the elevator opened and Theo stepped out into the messiest office he had ever seen.</p> <p>Sheets were sprawled across the room. Computers were on the floor. Desks had holes in them. It was the complete opposite of how it had looked when he first entered.</p> <p>He looked around carefully, wondering what could have caused this, and saw a massive crowd through the glass windows.</p> <p>There appeared the be a massive commotion, and a man was running quickly, terrified.</p> <p>Instantly, something crashed into the man, splitting his body in two and spraying blood onto the glass liberally.</p> <p>Theo jumped back, shocked, and another man appeared through the wall.</p> <p>&quot;Shadow?! What's going on? What are you doing?&quot; Theo asked, still disturbed by the image that he just saw.</p> <p>Panting, he replied. &quot;We were attacked by.. a terrifying stand. I just beat him... almost entirely out of luck. He could've killed us all and barely moved a muscle.&quot;</p> <p>He leaned back up, finally having enough oxygen to talk regularly.</p> <p>&quot;Where's Cipicao?&quot; he asked.</p> <p>Theo bit his lip. &quot;He's still downstairs.&quot; Theo couldn't bring himself to tell everyone yet. Especially not one by one.</p> <p>&quot;Where are Mboo and Pen, and what about the president?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Mboo and Pen are still in KFC. Pen's knocked out and Mboo's tending to him. Bubby was hurt badly but I managed to get him onto an ambulance. For now, we need to get the others and leave,&quot; Shadow explained.</p> <p>&quot;Why do we need to leave so urgently?&quot; Theo asked.</p> <p>&quot;Think about it. Regular people can't see stands. Foreign spies go to a shop with the POTUS and he ends up getting a hole in his stomach out of nowhere? We're in the goddamn Pentagon! We're going to have half of America on our tail.&quot;</p> <p>Theo's mouth made a perfect 'O' and he went up to the window, beckoning Shadow to follow.</p> <p>Shadow punched the window with his stand, and both himself and Theo walked through, only slightly resisted since it was so thin.</p> <p>They slipped through the crowd, faces lowered, and walked towards KFC. Theo took glimpses at the destruction around him, while Shadow kept his face forward, feeling the guilt of not beating the stand user quick enough.</p> <p>They reached KFC without causing more of a panic and saw Pen groggily getting up, Mboo supporting him with her stand.</p> <p>They noticed Theo and Shadow, who walked tentatively across the floor. It still looked like the remains of a war zone.</p> <p>Shadow explained their predicament quickly and the rest of the group agreed that they should leave quickly. They started to leave before Pen stopped them.</p> <p>&quot;Where's Cipicao?&quot; he asked.</p> <p>Shadow began to answer. &quot;Oh, he's still downstairs of the main building. You're right though, we should wai-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;No Shadow...&quot; Theo interrupted. He turned to face the group, avoiding eye contact with any of them.</p> <p>They all looked like they knew what he was going to say, but they wouldn't dare ask.</p> <p>&quot;We were attacked by a stand user. A famous assassin in fact. He... He killed Cipicao.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;And where is he?&quot; Pen asked.</p> <p>&quot;He's.. He back down where we fought.&quot; Theo answered.</p> <p>&quot;You just left him there?!&quot; Pen shouted, his voice cracking. He jumped up towards Theo, Mboo holding him back until he relaxed and took a few steps back. This news mixed with his light-headedness made him need to sit down.</p> <p>&quot;You just left him there?&quot; he whispered, traces of tears appearing in his eyes.</p> <p>Theo could have easily answered 'that's our job.' However, he could tell that justifying his actions wouldn't be the right move.</p> <p>Instead, he nodded solemnly. Finally, he dared to look up and stared into Pen's eyes, who stared back.</p> <p>Suddenly, an ethereal presence appeared from next to Pen and it struck into the wall with greater power than it normally could have. The impact tore it open, bricks falling down.</p> <p>Everyone was startled when he did this, still disturbed with the news. They may be spies who should be used to it, but they were still a team, and most importantly, they were still friends.</p> <p>&quot;And the mission?&quot; Mboo said tentatively. &quot;Do we know yp6's name?&quot;</p> <p>Theo nodded, then brought out the scrunched up piece of paper, showing it to the group. Pen took exceptional interest in this, leaning forward with a silent and stoic expression on his face.</p> <p>&quot;We need to go down to Florida,&quot; Theo explained. &quot;Cipicao, can you ge-&quot; he cut off his sentence, sighed and dropped his head.</p> <p>&quot;We'll need to get a car working to get there. Preferably, we'd want to use the car we were using before, but it might be recognised. For now though, our priority is getting out of here,&quot; he said shortly.</p> <p>The group slowly agreed, and they got up. Shadow poked his head through the hole in the wall Pen made and scanned the area, hoping that no one would see him and call a security guard.</p> <p>The coast was clear, but he could hear sirens in the distance swiftly approaching.</p> <p>He walked through the gap, beckoning the other to follow.</p> <p>His stand punched the walls covering the exit and he walked through slowly. After he walked through, the others followed.</p> <p>They started to walk towards their car, collectively reasoning that running away from the Pentagon after a massacre would be <em>somewhat</em> suspicious.</p> <p>They saw police cars and ambulances speeding towards the Pentagon, halting traffic in their tracks as they walked towards their car.</p> <p>After a nerve-wracking few minutes, they reached the spot where they parked it and entered the car, sirens still blaring as the news snaked across the city.</p> <h2 id="chapter-17-winding-through-the-city"><a href="#chapter-17-winding-through-the-city" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 17 - Winding Through the City</h2> <p>Left. Right. Roundabout. Straight ahead. Swerve.</p> <p>The group slithered around the city, avoiding the sirens that grew ever closer with every turn they took.</p> <p>Theo shouted directions while Pen followed them frantically, spinning the wheel as the hunk of metal jerked to comply.</p> <p>They turned onto a main road and a flash of red and blue appeared behind them like hawks. Pen accelerated, trying to escape the waves of policemen chasing them.</p> <p>Theo tried to shout, but it was already too late. A blockade had formed in front of them.</p> <p>Pen slowed, and he saw something to his right. Before he could comprehend anything, he was thrown left into the window and slept.</p> <p>A car had crashed into the nose of their own, shooting it away like a plastic counter pressed on the edge of another.</p> <p>Their car spun for a few moments, before stopping in its tracks. There was no movement.</p> <p>Several policemen left their cars and made an organised formation. Three went forward slowly, and the rest took cover behind their cars, aiming their guns at the car.</p> <p>The three policemen edged closer, forming a circle around the car. As the grew closer to the car, one tripped on a rock that had been rolling inexplicably.</p> <p>The other two took a few steps back, waiting for the other to get back up, still aiming their pistols at the shining new car. They stood completely and utterly still. The silence was kept, but it was fragile.</p> <p>At the peak of this tranquillity, chaos broke out. The wheels of the car screeched as they spun in place for a full five seconds, just like a character in Scooby Doo.</p> <p>The policemen shot at the car, and the whole city heard what sounded like a shootout.</p> <p>The car's wheels just spun, and finally, it took off.</p> <p>Every gun in the vicinity opened fire and there was no pause whatsoever in its barrage.</p> <p>Despite their best efforts, the car took off. One policeman saw something that confused him utterly.</p> <p>The first thing that caught his eye was that there were no bullet holes in the car. Before long, most of the people on the street saw that too.</p> <p>The second thing that he saw was that the person on the driver's seat was still completely knocked out, with a bad cut across his head. He definitely wasn't pretending, or even laying low. He was, without a doubt, out cold.</p> <p>It seemed the car took no notice of this, driving away from the blockade swiftly.</p> <p>Pen was still knocked out, and Mboo had pressed down the pedals with her stand. She also managed to repel the bullets from the car, which is how they made it out mostly unscathed.</p> <p>By this time, Theo was waking up, trying to take in his surroundings as his brain caught up with past events. After it all came back to him, he looked back at the police cars chasing them through the window, and a bullet skidded by his face!</p> <p>He jerked backwards, his heartbeat racing as a result of the adrenaline being pumped out into his body.</p> <p>This time, he chose to look forward through the windscreen as he watched out for more police cars.</p> <p>Looking around, he saw lights flashing in the sky, and he realised that helicopters had now been deployed to take care of them.</p> <p>He saw a machine gun emerge from the side of the helicopter and swivel into their general direction. Theo leaned over the seats, grabbing the wheel as his ribs were crushed by the gearstick and yanked it to the side, bringing it down an alleyway that barely had space for them.</p> <p>They still powered through, knocking bins forward until there was a painful screeching noise and metal scraped against brick.</p> <p>Theo looked out of the window and saw sparks flying from the car. There was no more space for them.</p> <p>Behind them, a few police officers had set up another formation, cars blocking the exit and the officers getting ready to open fire.</p> <p>Theo forced a ghostly presence out of his body, which then tore through the windshield with its fists. He also ripped off the seats, allowing Mboo to crawl out, carrying Shadow, who was just barely waking up.</p> <p>Theo pulled Pen out of the car. Once they were all out, they started sprinting further down the alleyway, Theo carrying Pen, who was starting to recover from the car crash earlier.</p> <p>They kept going straight before taking a left into an even deeper alley, hoping that by avoiding main roads they could lose the police.</p> <p>They heard the hum of a helicopter above them and they ducked even lower.</p> <p>&quot;Don't stop,&quot; Theo said. &quot;Just keep running, and don't lose each other.&quot;</p> <p>Shadow rushed ahead slightly and punched into one of the brick walls with his stand, beckoning everyone to follow him.</p> <p>He walked through the wall and took in his surroundings. He was in a fairly large and modern kitchen, with expensive-looking wood counters and a table with a sink in the centre.</p> <p>He got down low and essentially crawled across into a corridor, looking and hearing for any residents, when the others followed him in.</p> <p>After clearing the ground floor, he crawled up the stairs, cat-like, and looked at the rooms.</p> <p>There were three bedrooms, the third being a smaller room, possibly intended for storage, that was converted to a bedroom. There was also an upstairs bathroom.</p> <p>While it did seem like people lived there, no one was in.</p> <p>Shadow thanked his lucky stars and went back down the stairs and saw a terrified man holding a shaking gun at his companions, who held their hands up behind their heads.</p> <p>He tried to duck back, but the man saw his movements.</p> <p>&quot;G-get down here! I'll shoot your friends if you don't listen to me!&quot; he said, clearly scared.</p> <p>Shadow slowly walked down the steps, really hoping that there would be no sudden movement or noise that would cause the resident to lose his nerve and shoot.</p> <p>Too busy in his thoughts, Shadow stopped paying attention, and his foot caught on the wooden bannister. He started to fall, ready to bring out his stand to deal with the incoming chaos.</p> <p>However, before he realised it, he was standing straight on the stairs, ready to take another step. He analysed the situation in his head and realised that Mboo must have predicted the same outcome if the owner got shocked and reacted quickly enough to push him back on the steps.</p> <p>He walked down carefully, not allowing his mind to wander this time. He reached the bottom of the stairs and made a movement to kneel and put his hands by his head.</p> <p>However, what he was doing in actuality, was using his stand to take the owner's gun out of his hand.</p> <p>As he knelt down, he leaned forward and brought his stand out, reaching for the gun.</p> <p>Its fingers were inches away from its barrel. He still wasn't close enough.</p> <p>It was a gamble, but he had to do it. He fell forward on his face, hoping the unnerved gun-holder would not shoot.</p> <p>His stand's arm could easily reach for the gun now.</p> <p>He went to reach for it.</p> <p>BANG, a sound rang throughout the room.</p> <h2 id="chapter-18-help-of-the-police"><a href="#chapter-18-help-of-the-police" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 18 - Help of the Police</h2> <p>&quot;THIS IS THE POLICE! GET DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW!&quot;</p> <p>Before anyone had any time to react, the hinges of the front door flew open as it rattled forcefully.</p> <p>With one final hit, the door flew down and police officers stormed into the room, aiming their guns at the centre of the room, where a lone man stood, holding a pistol with his legs shaking.</p> <p>&quot;Put the gun down!&quot; one of the police officers said, but there was no need.</p> <p>First, the man's arms dropped. Then his knees. Finally, he fell to the ground, having fainted.</p> <p>After a couple of the police officers inspected him, dragging him onto the sofa when they were done, they stormed the rest of the house.</p> <p>About five stayed on the ground floor, which consisted of a living room and a kitchen with a little space separating it that also acted as a corridor. There were no walls and the corridor led to the front door.</p> <p>Shadow, Theo, Pen and Mboo curled up as quietly and tightly as possible on the circular, patterned rug between the sofa and television, watching as agents of the law searched every last bit of the house.</p> <p>Their diligence was commendable, but they could not have picked a worse time.</p> <p>Mboo had altered the light around the group using her stand, meaning the squad that raided the house could not see them. However, if they were to investigate enough, they would easily be found out.</p> <p>The clumped closer together, until they could sense the heat each of their bodies gave off.</p> <p>Then, one of the officers upstairs called back.</p> <p>&quot;There's nothing here! This house is clear!&quot;</p> <p>Their faces relaxed in relief, and they heard feet stomping down the stairs in unison as the officer went back down.</p> <p>One by one, they left the building, ready to raid another to look for the group.</p> <p>However, a hulking mass stood in the doorway, causing them to bump into him.</p> <p>In this commotion, one of the officers that most recently went down the stairs caught on Pen's leg, causing him to trip rapidly to the ground.</p> <p>&quot;Use your brains!&quot; the large figure thundered. &quot;That man was holding a gun before we came here. He was already terrified! Why would he be holding a gun in his own home, with his family outside, looking so unnerved? There were intruders!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Search the house, thoroughly this time!&quot;</p> <p>And in an instant, the officers began running around once more, looking for some clue of the group's location.</p> <p>They continued to sit in that spot, terrified that they would now be found. As they clumped up, Shadow watched the large man doing something bizarre.</p> <p>He was rolling up large amounts of newspaper. Then, he brought a lighter out from his pocket.</p> <p>At first, Shadow was watching in curiosity, wondering what he could be doing. Then, something clicked in his head.</p> <p>He brought out his stand, using it to hiss to Mboo, assuming that if his stand was speaking, then regular people would not be able to hear it.</p> <p>&quot;He's going to start a fire to create smoke around the room. It'll be affected once it reaches your range!&quot; his stand, Electric Funeral said.</p> <p>&quot;You're absolutely right. That is what I'm going to do. Unless... you would be kind enough to tell me where you are without me needing to harm the environment.&quot;</p> <p>Shadow turned back to the large man, who now stood facing the living room. He had a large smile on his face, and Shadow could see a light presence emerging at his side.</p> <p>Suddenly, the presence went behind the man's head, placing its webbed hands around it. Instantly, the man's muscle began to grow larger, and Shadow could see his physiology improve in other ways.</p> <p>Before any of them could react, the man rushed so quickly it left a brief afterimage. He scoured the room in a circle, slowly closing in to the group, still travelling at a terrifying speed.</p> <p>He edged ever closer until they could feel the whoosh of air as he passed them.</p> <p>Finally, he was adjacent to the circular rug. The man had a wide smile as he knew he had cornered the supposed criminals.</p> <p>He reached his hand out and his stand let go of his head. It snaked down his arm and flew into the circle until it grabbed a hold of something.</p> <p>At this point, the stand user could not see his stand. It was completely invisible, as Mboo's stand was still altering light.</p> <p>However, he could still feel around with his stand. The stand's fingers grabbed around something hard and quite clearly used its ability, but nothing happened.</p> <p>The stand tried once again, but there was still no result.</p> <p>Frustrated, the user pulled his stand back.</p> <p>&quot;Officers!&quot; he called. &quot;Shoot just above that rug!&quot;</p> <p>The police officers formed a line, just like a firing squad, and were fully prepared.</p> <p>&quot;FIRE!&quot; the large man roared.</p> <p>The row of police officers shot into the nothingness and the facade was finally broken.</p> <p>Like a glass that was shattered, their disguise ceased as Mboo focused her efforts towards stopping bullets. Finally, the group showed themselves.</p> <p>The gunfire continued, even more determined now that their adversaries had been revealed.</p> <p>Despite their efforts, no bullets reached them. The larger man called for them to stop firing, then looked the group up and down.</p> <p>&quot;It seems at least one of you have a similar power to me. I wouldn't be surprised if you all had one. I wonder if I'll be able to surpass myself with my <em>Quick One</em>,&quot; he monologued. &quot;That is my short term for it. <em>A quick one, while he's away</em> is its full name. It sounds.. elegant. I'm sure you can agree.&quot;</p> <p>Cutting off his own speech, he suddenly took off his jacket and threw it violently to the floor. He wore a white cotton vest, as well as a kevlar vest that covered it.</p> <p>He pointed at the group. &quot;You, who have attacked the President of the United States. I, Dragon, will overcome this challenge and defeat you with my ability!&quot;</p> <h2 id="chapter-19-yearning-for-justice"><a href="#chapter-19-yearning-for-justice" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 19 - Yearning for Justice</h2> <p>As if fired up by his own speech, the man named Dragon roared and jumped towards the group, who now stood up in a defensive formation, knowing that they could not underestimate a stand user.</p> <p>His stand one again climbed onto his shoulders and put its webbed fingers around Dragon's head again. This time, Pen could see something enter the man's ear.</p> <p>He looked for the source and saw that it was one of the stand's fingers, snaking into Dragon's brain.</p> <p>Once again, Dragon's body began to change as it became more muscular and athletic.</p> <p>He shot forward and brought his leg up, landing a kick on Pen, who stood closest, before Mboo pushed him back again with her stand.</p> <p>He landed casually on the floor, preparing to attack once again. However this time, Pen went forward first, bringing out his stand.</p> <p>This earned a mass of bullet rain aimed towards him, and Mboo pulled him back by the shirt physically, barely saving him from the bullets that spread out, inches from his face, trapped in the air by an invisible force he could only thank Mboo for.</p> <p>This time, instead of the bullets dropping to the floor into irrelevance, they were shot back into the row of officers, and large amount aimed towards Dragon, who stood in the centre.</p> <p>In the flash of an eye, Dragon had grabbed two pans from the kitchen and stacked them together with a slight air gap. He also angled them slightly.</p> <p>The bullets shot towards the policemen and Dragon, without a moment of hesitation, used the pans to deflect the bullets upwards into the ceiling. A few went through the first pan, but were stopped by the second like a double-glazed window.</p> <p>&quot;Don't shoot any more bullets!&quot; he called back to the officers behind him.</p> <p>Dragon assumed an eccentric thinking position, folding his legs twice and balancing on one, fingers stroking his chin like a cartoon character.</p> <p>The group was puzzled by this movement, but they wouldn't let it catch them out.</p> <p>Pen ran forward once more, this time unhindered by the chances of bullet fire.</p> <p>He brought his stand out and it made a jabbing motion with its elongated arms and fingers.</p> <p>Dragon still stood like that until the very last moment, when he disappeared again.</p> <p>Pen looked around for a clue to where Dragon had moved, unable to find him. Then, he felt a presence behind him.</p> <p>Behind him was a significantly smaller, more regular-sized form of Dragon, who had just gripped Pen's arms and held them behind his back like he was handcuffed.</p> <p>Pen could sense Dragon's stand somewhere near him, but he couldn't tell where.</p> <p>Pen brought his stand out and jabbed into Dragon's right arm. A look of great pain flittered across his face, and his right arm relaxed for a moment, but he kept a steady grip, even as Pen's stand, Mad World, pierced all the way through his arm, emerging from the other side.</p> <p>Dragon's own stand had now placed itself on Pen's head, and it was reaching its worm-like fingers into Pen's ears.</p> <p>Instantly, Pen felt weakened. &quot;What's the point,&quot; he muttered.</p> <p>He dropped to the ground, completely unwilling to fight. Dragon picked the physically and mentally weakened Pen and threw him over to the other police officers, who caught him and then held multiple guns against his head.</p> <p>Dragon's stand left Pen's head and returned to him, filling him up with energy once more, until he was a hulking mass, towering over the rest of the group who stood stunned at how quickly Pen had been disposed of.</p> <p>This wasn't a simple enemy like the ones they had faced before. This was a person with ambitions and ideals. He had more to fight for than himself. This made him an admirable and mighty stand user, and the worst person they could fight in such a place.</p> <p>The group's attention turned to Pen, who started regaining his form, focusing once again as if waking from a trance.</p> <p>Pen looked around and saw the situation he was in and panicked, wondering how he got there as his mind tried to recollect what happened.</p> <p>&quot;Don't let his stand touch your head!&quot; he shouted. &quot;It messe-&quot;</p> <p>The information he tried to give to the group was cut short by a firm jab in the back of his head by the butt of his gun, causing his to bite his tongue forcefully.</p> <p>As tears streamed from his eyes, his mouth was gagged and his hands were cuffed. Even with his stand powers, he could not dream to escape the barrels of the many guns pointed at him.</p> <p>Mboo stood in the centre of the remaining trio, attempting to cover them with her stand power like she was holding an umbrella and was tasked with protecting a group of a hundred from a hurricane.</p> <p>Or at least, that was how she felt in that situation, ten guns pointed at the group. She made the deflections look easy, but they were still hundreds of bullets that she had to catch, also having to distinguish between bullets and her friends.</p> <p>Even if they said they weren't going to shoot, it was terrifying. Even though they were all stand users, they were trapped in Mboo's bubble. If they left, they would just be caught by Dragon's stand.</p> <p>Somehow, his stand allowed him to power himself up to nearly superhuman levels. He basically caught goddamn bullets with that power!</p> <p>As if to make himself even more unnerving, Dragon undid his stand's power on himself, causing him to return to his normal state.</p> <p>Then, he reached forward and his stand flew towards the dome. As it reached Mboo's range, Dragon felt resistance, and he smiled confidently.</p> <p>His stand went to the ground. It hit the ground and brought its snake-like arms out. He brought them down and once they made contact with the laminated wooden floor, it was obliterated.</p> <p>A massive force pulled towards the site where the stand's hands touched. Even within Mboo's protective 'bubble' they could feel themselves being dragged by an invisible force.</p> <p>&quot;What?&quot; Theo said, straining to keep his feet in place. &quot;His power is to strengthen or weaken himself and others, how can he have more than one ability?&quot;</p> <p>Theo had an idea. He jumped and brought his stand out, intending to launch forward using the force that was pulling him.</p> <p>However, once he was over the spot where Dragon's stand touched, he was pulled straight down, as if a string had been tied to his belly button.</p> <p>He landed on the ground, hitting his jaw on the wooden floor. Even when he was flat on the ground, he felt it tugging hard at his stomach, until he could feel his body twisting and turning, making shapes that shouldn't be physically possible.</p> <p>Theo was being sucked into nothingness!</p> <h2 id="chapter-20-act-of-crime"><a href="#chapter-20-act-of-crime" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 20 - Act of Crime</h2> <p>Theo could feel his body changing shape as it accommodated the minuscule space. He brought out his stand's gargantuan fists and punched into the spot he felt the pulling come from.</p> <p>It had the opposite effect.</p> <p>His stand's arms felt the insane pull towards a spot below him. He tried to pull his stand back into his body, but it would not return. He strained and tensed his arms against the intense force at such an angle that there was no comfortable way to use his strength.</p> <p>In the middle of this focus, Theo didn't notice his stomach stretching and shrinking into an almost noodle-like shape.</p> <p>Shadow called out, but by the time he had even managed to get Theo's name out, Theo stopped being stretched and lay on the ground, face down.</p> <p>A police officer dashed forward and cuffed Theo, locking his hands behind his back.</p> <p>The officer turned Theo over onto his back, and his stomach was completely visible.</p> <p>The front part of Theo's belly looked like it had been stretched and rolled until it reached a metre long with barely a few centimetres diameter.</p> <p>Theo groaned loudly, the pain kicking in now that the actual physical effect had stopped.</p> <p>Shadow looked at the wound and hoped that not internal organs had been affected by that attack.</p> <p>Taking advantage of the temporary lack of attacks by Dragon, Mboo threw a lamp at him at breakneck speeds.</p> <p>As he was focusing on the now cuffed Theo, he did not see it coming until the last moment and barely moved his head, causing it to crash into the side of his face, shattering into hundreds of shards.</p> <p>One shard found itself cutting Dragon on the eyelid, causing him to drop to his knees, putting pressure on the cut to stop the pain.</p> <p>Hoping to follow up on her advantage, Mboo looked for something else to throw, but there were very few things.</p> <p>She picked up a TV remote and threw it at full speed. It took all of Dragon's willpower to even acknowledge the fact he was being attacked while his eye screamed into his brain.</p> <p>He dragged his head downwards, but as it turned out, there was no need. One of the officers behind him grabbed it out of the air, knowing Dragon would not be able to react quickly enough.</p> <p>The officer threw it back at Mboo, who stopped it in its tracks fairly easily.</p> <p>The two sides were at a standoff. If Shadow left Mboo's range, he would be beaten easily, ending up like Pen and Theo, or worse.</p> <p>The police officers could not do much except protect themselves, as their bullets would be stopped. Dragon clearly had the upper hand. His stand was strong and it puzzled the Mi6 members who were still standing.</p> <p>Once again, Dragon's stand became active. It rubbed its hands together and both Shadow and Mboo felt its pull once more.</p> <p>This time, however, it felt weaker. Shadow took advantage of this and tried to unnerve Dragon.</p> <p>&quot;Your stand seems quite simple. You create some kind of area that has a large gravitational pull, like a black hole. There is nowhere near the power to match a black hole though,&quot; he said. &quot;You're weakened right now. I can feel it in the pull on my legs. Even if you were to enhance your own abilities, I assume by using that pull to affect your hormonal levels, as long as your pull is that weak, you're no longer a challenge.&quot;</p> <p>Dragon said nothing, his face stoic as blood dried across his cheek from the lamp's impact.</p> <p>Shadow shot forward, confident that Dragon was weakened. He brought his stand out and pulled back his fist, ready to punch Dragon.</p> <p>Suddenly, he felt a massive impact on his stomach, causing him to cough hoarsely as he was winded massively.</p> <p>His stomach was attacked a few times more, and he felt his body go up. He looked down and saw the tiny body of Dragon's stand, packing massive physical power.</p> <p>Of course, it had a lot of power, Shadow thought to himself. It was quite clearly a short-range power-based stand. It had a deceptively small body though.</p> <p>Despite the pain, Shadow still had the reactions to punch the ceiling over him with his stand, causing him to flow through it like as if it was water or jelly.</p> <p>The people on the ground floor heard a devastating crash as Shadow continued into the ceiling of the second floor.</p> <p>Dragon focused his attention onto Mboo, who stood a little unnerved. The rest of her team had essentially been beaten. Neither side had a large advantage and she could not dare to rush forward and attack.</p> <p>Dragon and Mboo were too busy staring into each other's eyes, daring the other to attack first, to notice the things going on around them. A scratching noise came from the ceiling, shifting over to just above the kitchen area where the policemen were.</p> <p>Pen was taking his stand out slowly, expecting something big to happen. He was also looking at Theo's wound, trying to judge how bad it was.</p> <p>Mboo looked at her environment again, searching for something to chuck at Dragon, but she could not find anything that could possibly hurt him.</p> <p>Dragon noticed her being stranded on her stand's 'island' of protection and smiled to himself, knowing that he had finally defeated all of them.</p> <p>He brought out his stand and moved it about four or five metres ahead of him and it rubbed its webbed hands together, preparing to use its ability again.</p> <p>Mboo felt the gravitational pull on her whole body, telling every muscle she had to disappear into that hole.</p> <p>She did feel that it was weaker, but that didn't mean it was weak. The sofa next to her made a deathly noise as it scraped across the wooden floor, years of dust getting unglued from the gap between the floor and the sofa legs.</p> <p>The edge closest to the point they were getting pulled to started to change shape into the string-like form that Theo's stomach was in as it was sucked into nothingness.</p> <p>Then, in the middle of this commotion, a massive crashing noise reverberated throughout the room.</p> <p>Mboo looked up and saw Shadow's stand punch Dragon in the back of the head, sending him crashing into the floor, face first, breaking the laminated wooden planks, leaving a crater of splintered wood.</p> <p>Shadow was close behind his stand, landing on the floor and turning his attention on the police officers who were now lifting up their guns, shocked by what just transpired.</p> <p>Pen took advantage of this situation and used his stand to stab the police officers in the hands, causing them to drop their guns, clutching their hands together.</p> <p>Pen used his stand to stab into his cuffs, but they did not break. However, he didn't let this distract him. He jabbed into Dragon's calf with its spindly fingers, twisting it after it made contact in order to further incapacitate him.</p> <p>Dragon stayed crumpled in a weird praying position, face flat on the ground. He barely reacted to Pen carving into his leg.</p> <p>Mboo watched all of this happen and once everyone went down, she rushed in and grabbed Theo, supporting his completely unconscious body, assisted by her stand as well as Shadow.</p> <p>They walked out of the back door hurriedly, Pen stepping backwards, keeping his eyes on the crime scene they left behind.</p> <p>They ran back out into the alleys, carrying Theo as they raced against law enforcement to escape the city.</p> <h2 id="chapter-21"><a href="#chapter-21" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 21</h2> <p>The group ran outside, sprinting for their lives as they escaped the crime scene they left behind in a poor stranger's house.</p> <p>They went down every turn they could see, losing track of where they were in a bid to escape their pursuers.</p> <p>They turned into a dead end and panicked briefly before Shadow punched the wall, using his stand to permit everyone he chose through the wall.</p> <p>After passing through the wall, they found themselves in a multi-leveled car park. They were on the ground floor, and it went down to two basement floors and three more above ground.</p> <p>They rushed down to the basement floors, where there were fewer cars. There was almost no background noise. It felt completely solitary, as if the four of them were disturbing a graveyard that kept silence in respect for their fallen heroes.</p> <p>They felt as if they were the only things in existence, but they ran. They heard squeaks of shoes on floors and the shouts of their pursuers, and the hallowed space around them was finally lost.</p> <p>They sprinted to the other side of the car park and ran into a metal door that blocked their escape once more. At this point it was second nature for Shadow to punch the wall, permitting the rest to slide through.</p> <p>They emerged into an upwards road that intersected with a larger road. They looked at their surroundings and saw that they recognised some parts around them, and sudden realisation came to them.</p> <p>The car park they just left that was now being swarmed by tens of police officers was the one they had parked their car in.</p> <p>They ran around, Mboo still hauling Theo on her shoulders, supporting him using her stand, so that they could get to the front entrance, but as they turned the corner, they saw police officers guarding it.</p> <p>They doubled back and tried to hide, but it was too late. They were seen.</p> <p>A police officer who saw them called out to them, telling them to come out from behind the corner of the building.</p> <p>After a moment of hesitation, Pen stepped out from the shadows, head down and his hands up.</p> <p>&quot;Put your hand behind your back and get on your knees!&quot; the officer called, more of them lining up behind him. They didn't aim their guns at him yet as there was the chance he was a civilian, but they still had them ready to go in case something happened.</p> <p>The officers approached Pen slowly, getting ready to detain him due to his presence at a suspicious location and his likeness to the warrant that was produced surprisingly quickly.</p> <p>Pen went to his knees, hoping his sacrifice would allow the others to make some kind of escape.</p> <p>Suddenly, a truck came blaring past them, and everyone turned their heads. The police officers looked at each other and nodded, a group of them leaving and heading into a car to chase down the truck.</p> <p>Pen took advantage of the confusion and rolled towards the wall, hoping that Shadow would have the same idea he did.</p> <p>Pen kept rolling until he hit a solid bump, and he despaired as he knew he was left outside and would be arrested shortly.</p> <p>He opened his eyes, ready to accept his fate and was instead met by a bright, artifical light, blocked by a silhouette.</p> <p>His eyes focused and he saw that he managed to go through the wall, but he rolled right into a police officer, who had no clue how Pen could've appeared there.</p> <p>The officer grabbed his pistol and aimed at Pen. Pen began to take his stand out, but there was no need as Shadow swiftly delivered a punch into the officer's jaw.</p> <p>He pulled Pen up, commenting on the punch. &quot;I really wish I didn't have to keep hurting these guys, especially in their faces. Ugh.. why can people only be knocked out reliably with head shots?&quot; he asked himself.</p> <p>After they both stood up, the group crouched behind a short concrete wall, judging the inside of the car park.</p> <p>They scanned the inside of the area, racking their brains as they tried to remember where they had parked. They were too focused on completing their mission to remember where they had parked even a few minutes after leaving to go to the Pentagon.</p> <p>Thankfully, due to the commotion outside, most of the police officers assumed that there would be no one left in the car park and started to make their separate ways out.</p> <p>They waited in absolute silence, Mboo cloaking their presence with her stand as they watched the hands of the law funnel out of each exit.</p> <p>After nearly everyone had left, they snuck around the floor, searching for their car, hoping they wouldn't trash it like the one they stole from the car dealership.</p> <p>After about of minute of near-panicked searching, they found the car. Once again, Mboo unlocked it using her stand, Shadow holding Theo up while she did so.</p> <p>They went inside, Pen and Shadow taking up the front seats, while Mboo laid Theo on the back seats tenderly before sitting next to him.</p> <p>They drive out into the darkness that now encompassed the outside as night took over the world.</p> <p>Under the cover of night, escaping from the police felt more surreal. It was like they were in a dream, safe in their bed as the world chugged on. Yet, they drove.</p> <p>They snuck around the city, watching as police cars followed every trail they could, helicopters beaming their search lights onto the streets.</p> <p>Finally, after hours of tension, they found the road they needed and left the city that lay awake in the coldest hours of the morning.</p> <p>The group drove for hours, exhausted by what had happened the day before. Mboo fell asleep quickly, but was woken up by Theo's groans as he clutched his stomach, feeling the thin string of flesh between his fingers, testing the pain as he came to the realisation that this was part of his own body.</p> <p>He tried to sit up, but the pain was too sharp when he clenched his stomach. He lay awake, feeling the pain in his stomach flare and weaken as the car took turns and hit speed bumps in school zones, with only one thing on his mind:</p> <p>Marcus Kvalheim in Miami.</p> <h2 id="chapter-22"><a href="#chapter-22" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 22</h2> <p>The group drove on until they felt they were far enough away from Washington D.C to be safe.</p> <p>They stopped at a fairly large gas station. It had a Starbucks and a Pizza Hut.</p> <p>They went to the Starbucks, getting coffees for each of them before returning to the car, reasoning that they won't be overheard or recognised by staying away from very public places.</p> <p>They were considered terrorists now, and they had to be aware of that. They sat next to the car, which they parked quite far from the main buildings, where they bordered a small patch of forest.</p> <p>Theo laid down on the back of the car, which had a retractable bench of sorts that came from the boot. He started the talk.</p> <p>&quot;So, our destination is Florida. I don't doubt that yp6 will be there. Judging from his behaviour, I think he'll see us as a challenge to overcome, proving to the world that he is stronger than them,&quot; he started.</p> <p>&quot;Our main difficulty, however,&quot; he continued, &quot;is our status as criminals who have infiltrated the Pentagon and attacked the president with intent to kill, if he hasn't died of his wounds yet, not to mention the hundred or so people that died due to the stand attack.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Surely if the president was dead news would be around by now?&quot; Mboo asked.</p> <p>Theo shook his head. &quot;They won't announce something like that the day after it happened. The White House will need time to prepare and reassure the public once it happens. America is very patriotic. They see the president as their icon of safety. Proof that they live in a great country. The government can't shake those foundations yet, especially since there's only two things that could happen next. Either, yp6 takes credit and the public lives in fear and conspiracy, or they blame the UK, and tensions rise to a high as countries choose their allies.&quot;</p> <p>Mboo stared in silence, finally fully taking in how big their situation was.</p> <p>&quot;So this means we have to succeed in subduing yp6 without drawing any more negative attention to ourselves, or getting caught by security agents, right?&quot; Pen asked.</p> <p>Theo nodded. &quot;Right.&quot;</p> <p>Pen nodded back, then stood up, stretching his legs and walking into the woods next to them.</p> <p>He simply stood in place, looking up and forwards to the sky that was hidden by the canopy. He made to reach for that light, but he was brought back to Earth.</p> <p>Someone had tapped him on the shoulder. Pen turned around and saw Shadow, who sat down next to him.</p> <p>After a moment's pause, Pen sat down as well. &quot;What do you want to talk about?&quot; he asked.</p> <p>&quot;How does your stand work?&quot; Shadow asked.</p> <p>Pen squinted at Shadow, confused. After a little while, he realised that he had never explained his stand to Shadow and he got beaten pretty quickly both times the two fought together.</p> <p>Pen brought out his stand, showing its elongated limbs. It had quite a bizarre shape, but it also looked quite ominous.</p> <p>&quot;This is my stand. As you can see, it's pretty well designed for stabbing with its fingers. It's a relatively slow stand, but it has some destructive power.</p> <p>It can also write on things in any material,&quot; he explained. He walked over to a tree next to him and wrote on it.</p> <p>Shadow tilted his head. &quot;What language is that?&quot; he asked.</p> <p>&quot;Oh right, I didn't tell you. My stand can write in any language regardless of whether I know it or not.&quot;</p> <p>Shadow nodded, and a thought crossed his mind. &quot;Does that mean... we can confirm whether aliens exist or not?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Well, if your stand can write in any language, even if you don't know it, then if there are aliens, wouldn't you be able to write in their language?&quot; Shadow explained.</p> <p>Pen thought it over, then turned back to the tree. His stand's elongated fingers scratched over the wood, leaving its mark.</p> <p>The result was a language they had never seen before. Shadow and Pen looked slightly freaked out, and really excited.</p> <p>They looked at each other, then up to the sky. There were really aliens out there.</p> <p>&quot;What are you doing, guys?&quot; Mboo asked, stepping down to them.</p> <p>&quot;You're never gonna believe this, Mboo,&quot; Shadow said, barely able to contain his excitement.</p> <p>Mboo tilted her head, wondering what Shadow was going to say.</p> <p>Shadow put his arm over her shoulder and whispered into her ear like he was telling the biggest scandal ever.</p> <p>&quot;Aliens... are... real.&quot;</p> <p>Mboo whispered back, putting her arm over Shadow's shoulder just like he was. &quot;How do you know?&quot;</p> <p>Shadow nodded his head to the writing on the tree.</p> <p>&quot;Why is there Hebrew on that tree?&quot; Mboo asked.</p> <p>Shadow choked on his spit.</p> <p>&quot;Wh-what? What Hebrew, there's no Hebrew here!&quot; he said, his dreams deflating.</p> <p>&quot;Yeah there is. It says 'Aliens are real' on that tree. Is that your proof?&quot; she said, unimpressed.</p> <p>Shadow looked back at Pen, who looked as heartbroken as he was.</p> <p>&quot;Nevermind,&quot; Shadow sighed, turning back to Pen.</p> <p>Shadow crouched down, and Pen followed suit.</p> <p>They sat down for a couple minutes, wallowing in their silence, before Shadow spoke again.</p> <p>&quot;Your stand can write in <em>any</em> material, right?&quot; he asked.</p> <p>&quot;Yeah, why?&quot; Pen answered.</p> <p>&quot;So... wouldn't you be able to write in something super corrosive and be able to melt your way through things?&quot;</p> <p>Curious, Pen made a motion like he was writing on the air in front of him, and Shadow saw his stand do the same in front of him, imparting his words on the tree.</p> <p>After his stand returned to him, they watched the fruit of their labour.</p> <p>A liquid was now bubbling and sizzling in the tree, eating its way through the bark and dripping downwards.</p> <p>Pen had written 'test' initially, but now the liquid had clawed its way down the tree, leaving an ominous hole in its trunk.</p> <p>Pen looked back at Shadow, excited. &quot;That's awesome!&quot; he said. &quot;I honestly never thought of it that way. I just kind of went with the edgy stuff like blood cause it looked kinda creepy.&quot;</p> <p>Pen turned back and did his writing motion towards the ground. Under his finger, a strange material appeared.</p> <p>Shadow stroked his fingers across it. He couldn't mistake the rough feeling.</p> <p>&quot;That's wood?&quot;</p> <p>Pen nodded. &quot;It seems like I can create of thin layer of pretty much anything when I write. I don't know how useful it'll be but at least it's a new way to use my stand.&quot;</p> <p>He looked back at Shadow.</p> <p>&quot;Thanks man.&quot;</p> <p>Shadow shrugged as if to say, 'no problem'.</p> <h2 id="chapter-23"><a href="#chapter-23" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 23</h2> <p>After about half an hour of loitering next to the car, they started getting ready to leave. They threw their rubbish away and bought things to eat and do until their next stop.</p> <p>Shadow went with Mboo to buy food for them before their next stop.</p> <p>&quot;You know, Shadow...&quot; Mboo started, seeming quite confused.</p> <p>&quot;Why do you commit so much of yourself to this. This is your first mission, you're clearly quite young and one of ours has already died.</p> <p>There's no reason for you to care as much as you do,&quot; she asked him.</p> <p>Shadow shrugged while picking up granola bars from the shelves, his eyes looking downwards as if he was protecting a secret deep within him.</p> <p>He sighed through his nose and looked up.</p> <p>&quot;It would be cliché to say I wanted to be a spy since I was young cause it seemed cool, but that is what started it, I think.</p> <p>A lot of children's shows make it look like a life of adventure and that stuck with me up until now.&quot;</p> <p>He paused for a while, continuing to pick out food. Mboo didn't interrupt, sensing there was more to say.</p> <p>&quot;I guess it's also.. because I felt like I wanted to become stronger. I had this power since I was born, but it was useless. It didn't save anyone when it mattered.&quot; Shadow noticed Mboo's sympathetic look and noticed he was going off on a tangent.</p> <p>&quot;Sorry, I guess you don't have the context of my life experience so you don't know what I'm talking about,&quot; Shadow murmured. He squatted onto the floor, neatly layering the snacks he was going to buy.</p> <p>&quot;You remember how bad it was back in 2016, right? Terror attacks in Europe almost daily, clowns running around everywhere. It felt like a thing of the past after the year ended. At least, it did for the people who didn't lose anything.</p> <p>I went shopping with my mum back during those times. She was waiting for me outside the store and right as I was going out-&quot; Shadow cut himself off, feeling liquid rising up his throat.</p> <p>&quot;My stand didn't help then. It barely is now.. We've already lost one person and I couldn't do a thing to help.</p> <p>I joined this place so I could help people, but not like a doctor or a policeman. I wanted to stop the problems at its root, or at least what I thought was a root.&quot;</p> <p>After a moment of silence, Shadow snapped out of his daze and picked up the snacks in front of him, scanning the aisles for anything else that piqued his interest.</p> <p>Mboo just watched on, wishing that she could say something, anything that might let him feel better.</p> <p>She opened her mouth, her voice finally ready to say something, but Shadow was already at the till, beckoning her to bring the items to the front to pay for them.</p> <p>She followed, biting her lip at her own cowardice and insensitivity.</p> <p>They went back to the car once they were done, where they saw Pen in the driver's seat, talking to Theo. Once they noticed the pair arriving, Theo spun around slowly until he was sitting up and Mboo once again sat next to him.</p> <p>Since Pen had driven most of the way up until now, Shadow took the wheel for the next part of this journey.</p> <p>At the Starbucks, far away from the attention of the spies, a lanky teenage boy wearing a navy blue suit was fiddling with a camera.</p> <p>He rummaged through his bag constantly, changing every part of the camera until he was satisfied.</p> <p>He pointed it to something out of the window, keeping absolutely still, his left hand sprayed out in such a way that the camera was help up by his middle and ring finger, while the remaining 3 made a solid base.</p> <p>He took a picture and leaned away from the camera, taking a look at the picture he took.</p> <p>He looked at its nuances, following every line that was on on the screen, watching how that collection formed the picture in front of him.</p> <p>The lines waved and shifted, but a silhouette was always in the centre.</p> <p>The teenager took three more pictures, all with the same amount of precision and care as the first because naturally, the teenager thought, what can a picture be without love. You must nurture a picture for it to become something beautiful. There is no beauty in a result if there is no beauty at the beginning.</p> <p>And what bigger beauty is there than love?</p> <p>&quot;Hey Theo, have you ever liked anyone before?&quot;</p> <p>Theo was taken off his guard and choked on his own spit, coughing and hacking for a few moments. Finally, he looked up at Mboo, his eyes watering.</p> <p>&quot;We're on a mission where we're risking our lives, day in and day out. We are wanted criminals, and you're asking me that now?!&quot; he exclaimed.</p> <p>&quot;Come on boss..&quot; she drawled. &quot;Don't avoid the question. Or maybe,&quot; she put the tips of her fingers on his stomach, placing one finger above the next as it crawled up his chest like a spider, &quot;you have a really big crush you can't get over!&quot;</p> <p>Mboo leaned backwards, pointing her finger to her head like she had solved a sphynx's riddle.</p> <p>Theo tilted his head, puzzled. &quot;Of course I don't, stop being silly. Why would I ever have one?&quot;</p> <p>Pen turned his head, joining into the conversation. &quot;Eh, you were a stick in the mud since you were born, Theo? I thought that might just have been cause you had the arduous task of taking care of all of us.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What?! I'm not a stick in the mud!&quot; Theo's face got redder and redder as time passed, Pen and Mboo teasing him over and over until they reached a convenient time to stop.</p> <p>Once again, they found a forest to hide out in, this time driving the car down into the woods.</p> <p>The group made a small campfire, where they boiled water for their cup noodles and prepared tea bags to be used later.</p> <p>Theo sat happily in the car's trunk that was once again pulled down, allowing him to sit down there, watching his team talk amongst themselves cheerfully. He admired their courage, being able to talk so easily while being hunted by the forces of good and evil in the world.</p> <p>Theo wondered whether he could ever have that same courage.</p> <p>Theo laid his head down onto a softer spot and began drifting into a state of sleep.</p> <p>His eyes blurred as he watched the group, a content smile on his face. He heard the sound of a wind chime tinkling and clinking peacefully, and he drifted to the Aether.</p> <p>He woke up slowly, sitting up and stretching his arms behind his neck, feeling his joints click. He knew it probably wasn't healthy, but he kept on doing it anyway. He ended his series of stretched by clicked his neck, his kind full of those horror stories where a person became paralysed after clicking their neck.</p> <p>Suddenly, he was pulled up by the collar and was shaken around!</p> <h2 id="chapter-24"><a href="#chapter-24" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 24</h2> <p>Theo shook his way out the the grip on his shoulders and looked up to see the culprit. He saw Mboo with a massive smile on her face, and sighed, mentally preparing himself for what she was going to say.</p> <p>&quot;What do you want, Mboo? Also, couldn't you have woken me up a least a little more kindly?&quot; Theo asked groggily.</p> <p>Mboo shook her head defiantly. &quot;This is way too cool for me to be kind!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What does that even mean..?&quot; Theo muttered whilst getting up.</p> <p>&quot;Well, we were looking around a little and we saw this cabin next to a lakeside. It seemed really cosy so I thought that maybe we could all spend a little time there!&quot;</p> <p>It seemed like no one could say no to Mboo when she was like this. After quite a bit of reluctance from Theo, - &quot;Who's going to watch the car?&quot; - the group slowly made their way to the cabin.</p> <p>It was extremely dark, so no one took any liberties in their steps, treading carefully as leaves crunched beneath their feet, painfully loud in the overwhelming silence.</p> <p>Theo tread even more carefully. He could walk now, but he didn't want to disturb his injuries.</p> <p>They stepped across, hearing animals of the night go on with their small, but no less important lives.</p> <p>&quot;Are you sure this is the right way?&quot; Theo called. &quot;Do we even know the way back?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Of course we do, we'll just walk backwards if we get lost!&quot; Mboo answered back.</p> <p>&quot;That's the opposite of what getting lost means,&quot; Theo muttered under his breath.</p> <p>Finally, after they trudged along some more, they saw a clearing up ahead.</p> <p>Mboo and Shadow rushed ahead, able to walk a little faster as little beams of light crept in between the branches and thickets.</p> <p>Pen also sped up, though he didn't leave Theo in the dark, which Theo appreciated internally.</p> <p>Finally, he stepped out into the light and took in his surroundings.</p> <p>The trees opened up into a lake that shimmered and gleamed as moonlight and fireflies lit up the air and water, causing breaks in the darkness around them.</p> <p>Theo stood still for a few moments, captivated by the scene. It reminded him that even though the world had bad things, it still kept its beauty, especially in nature. His daydreaming was interrupted by Mboo calling out his name, returning him to this earth.</p> <p>He walked to the cabin that was placed perfectly next to the lake. It was close enough that it was a feature, but far enough that both could be enjoyed separately.</p> <p>Vines had started to grow on the cabin. A testament to its age and abandonment. However, nature would not allow anything to be ugly next to such a dazzling body of water.</p> <p>The vines seeped perfectly into the trees behind it, creating an illusion that the hut stretched into the woods.</p> <p>Theo could only imagine what this place would look like in the peak of spring.</p> <p>However, he thought to himself while looking around, it looked infinitely prettier at night.</p> <p>He caught up with Pen and the pair entered the house together.</p> <p>Behind the door was a well-preserved living room with a fireplace and a box TV on top of an oak stand.</p> <p>Mboo was sitting on a large chair, swinging it back and forth as she sunk into its comfortable back.</p> <p>&quot;Shadow went on to explore the house more,&quot; she said, a look of absolute bliss on her face.</p> <p>Pen went to explore the adjacent kitchen, while Theo took the stairs to the basement.</p> <p>Before he entered, he looked around for a light, but there didn't seem to be one. He shrugged his shoulders, assuming that it would be at the end of the staircase, and took the steps down.</p> <p>Very quickly he realised that there wasn't actually any light inside the house and the only way they were able to see before was because of the moonlight seeping in through the windows. As such, the steps descended into darkness within moments.</p> <p>Instinctively, he started to walk slower, both out of a natural fear of the unknown and in response to the remaining injury in his stomach.</p> <p>He kept taking slow steps until he was enveloped in darkness. The fact that he couldn't see the step in front of him was terrifying, but he kept going.</p> <p>As he took more steps, he became confused. He must've taken many steps and there was no way he wasn't the basement yet. He poked his head forward, somehow reasoning that he would somehow be able to see more if he leaned forward.</p> <p>Right as he did so, he felt a small whoosh of air along his face, light enough for him to feel it, but not enough to disturb even a strand of his hair.</p> <p>Theo was already unnerved, and this event caused him to jump backwards, hitting his ankle on the stone step and falling back. He landed ungracefully on his tailbone, leaving him in shattering pain in his back and ankle.</p> <p>After breathing through his teeth sharply until the pain subsided, he touched his heel, feeling upwards until he reached the pain.</p> <p>His ankle had scraped painfully and messily, leaving a large amount of dust on it.</p> <p>He decided to go back up in order to clean it, but as he looked back up the staircase, he found that he couldn't see a door whatsoever. He was in pitch darkness.</p> <p>Theo felt like puking, but he realised that sitting still wouldn't help him.</p> <p>He decided to go downwards, reasoning that the previous residents might have kept a first aid kit in the basement.</p> <p>This time, he stay sat down, using his hands to pull him down the stairs, not risking another trip.</p> <p>After a painstaking few seconds that felt like minutes to Theo, he could no longer feel any more steps below him and he lifted himself up slowly.</p> <p>He blindly felt around for some sort of light and after searching for a few moments he thanked the stars and his hands wrapped around a string.</p> <p>He pulled it down until there was an audible click. He looked around into the darkness, but there was no change. Not even a flicker of light.</p> <p>He shrunk disappointedly, annoyed that he would have to navigate in pitch blackness.</p> <p>Once he opened his eyes, he resolved to just work through it, light or no light.</p> <p>However, it seemed he didn't need to steady his heart, as there was a flicker on the ceiling.</p> <p>A few more flickers passed by and the light finally filled the room as best it could.</p> <p>Theo looked around at his surroundings. The light was formed by small bulbs strung across the ceiling, similar to Christmas lights, casting a pale white light onto the concrete floor.</p> <p>The basement seemed decorated to be some sort of garage. There was a workbench with a variety of tools scattered on it along one of the walls. It made sense, seeing as this house was quite far from a town or city.</p> <p>The residents most likely did shopping in large amounts, making more permanent objects down here in the basement themselves.</p> <p>On the other side, there were regular home appliances. An old washing machine, dryer and a dishwasher.</p> <p>The interior designer within Theo couldn't help but criticise the owner's use of space.</p> <p>In the middle of Theo's design class, the lights flickered momentarily before switching off entirely.</p> <p>Theo stood still, annoyed at the faulty electronics, waiting for them to turn back on, but there was no response.</p> <p>After a few moments, Theo realised that he'd have to once again navigate in the darkness. This time, there would be no hope of the light turning back on.</p> <p>Theo started to step towards the wall, reaching his arms out and shuffling his feet until his hands felt resistance. He slid his body to the wall and held his back against it.</p> <p>However, he noticed, the shuffling sound his feet were making weren't stopping.</p> <p>He looked around into the darkness, looking for the source of the noise.</p> <p>Left. He was sure it was to the left of him. He tried to listen to the floor, assuming that it must be a rat or something similar. This was an older building that wasn't maintained so it made sense.</p> <p>However, this shuffling felt heavier, and.. looser. There was no way Theo could put his sense into words, but he was sure of it in the deepest levels of his instinctual humanity.</p> <p>Whatever was making the noise was not a small critter.</p> <p>Theo leaned further back against the wall, feeling safer when his back wasn't exposed.</p> <p>He stood absolutely still, but the shuffling had stopped once again, not allowing Theo to pinpoint it once again.</p> <p>Theo looked around into the darkness, heart racing when the lights flickered for just a moment. Theo saw a shadow directly in front him and he punched forward, an ethereal fist appearing in front of his own before separating and launching an attack in front of Theo.</p> <p>He kept on going, not allowing himself to be paralysed by his fear, but he knew nothing was happening. He felt no connection with his fists, but he kept punching until he was tired.</p> <p>He dropped his fists despairingly, ready to accept whatever would happen to him. However, right before his heart had given up, the lights turned back on and Theo reacted instantly.</p> <p>He punched towards the darkness he could now see, and this time, he felt his fists impact on something solid.</p> <p>He let loose, throwing with all his might as he wanted to utterly remove this being that had been chasing him.</p> <p>As he let his final punch, he marvelled at how it stayed completely still, like a punching bag that would take all trauma thrown at it.
He finally looked up at what had been following him.</p> <p>It was Shadow, eyes red but lifeless. He lay limp like a person that had been lynched, but he was entirely upright.</p> <p>Shadow's body was in tatters. Holes that ripped through his shirt went all the way through his body, blood streamed from his eyes. There was a hole the size of a coin going in and out both sides of his throat, a maggot emerging from his right. It was as if his body had been decomposing for weeks, but it still hung in the air in front of Theo.</p> <p>Theo's knees lost their steading, and Shadow's arm rose.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
