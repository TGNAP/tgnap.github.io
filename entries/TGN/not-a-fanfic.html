Does it even smell nice? When I go into a bookshop and light slithers its way through the slight gaps in the dark purple curtains, I see specks sparkle and dance about. Two things come into my mind when I see it. It's pretty. It's strange how something supposedly bad for us could look so pretty with just a hint of light. The second thought is slightly more boring, if science isn't what you're into. But, can science really be boring? When I look at the dust, I might see its superficial, fleeting beauty, but there are those who look and think, is there more to this? Robert Brown looked at it and thought about it, and it led to the furthering of humanity. How does someone look at something and see more than just the outside. How do you look at the inside?</p> <p>Back to our bookstore. I walk down the corridors of endless knowledge, my eyes skipping over tomes and bibles. I hate how I pretend to think about things existentially. The extent of my knowledge is half-remembered details from school that barely affect my daily life. No matter how steadfast I am with my views, it's useless if I don't hold myself to them.</p> <p>My melancholy outlook must have shown on my face, because the owner of the bookshop, MelonMints, approached me. He didn't do anything at first. He sat down near me, carefully resting his back against the shelves so as not to disturb even a hair that might have made its way to the top of a book there. This gestured silently encouraged me to follow suit, and I did so, albeit not as gracefully as this swan. We stayed there for a few moments, before he procured a book out of nowhere and placed it on my lap. It looked ancient. It was one of those old books where the title wasn't even on the front cover. I turned it over and read the words on the spine, embroidered with the imprint of golden flowers. It was called &quot;The Vanishing of Hector Livingstone&quot;. Everything about the book, from its cover to its name seemed pretentiously Victorian. A failed classic. A vanishing as well. What an overdone topic. As if detective stories weren't flayed to death in books and then boiled in Mercury when televised adaptations started to gain traction.</p> <p>Melon looked at me, frowning slightly, as if he were trying to read my emotions. He must be pretty good at this because without hesitation, he picked on my thoughts. &quot;Are you judging a book by its cover Cousland?&quot; I opened my mouth slightly. I'm not sure why I did. Maybe I wanted to defend myself, but I knew there was no avoiding it. Melon was too observant. Or maybe, I was an open book to him. I sniffed at how fitting it would be. &quot;Let me guess. 'It looks like a cliché book in an overdone genre from an overzealous era'.&quot; I looked down, stunned by his accuracy. Forget an open book, it was more like I was a story he read when he was seven and reread so often there wasn't a line he couldn't recite.</p> <p>Without hearing my reply, which would've been a half-hearted defence anyway, he went on to explain his choice. &quot;While your concerns aren't the most admirable - at least not by society's hypocritical standards - they aren't misplaced. A lot of stories have clear inspirations or ancestors, and detective novels end up being reskins of previous ones to anyone who's read more than two. Which..&quot; he continued after stretching his arms, making a relieved face that would've seemed exaggerated on anyone but him. &quot;..is why I gave you this one. Books that have only one predictable plot aren't good. They're either forgotten or early enough that they made the genre. So.. why do hidden gems exist?&quot; He paused, as if his question wasn't actually rhetorical.</p> <p>After the pause stretched out just a moment longer, I took the opportunity to answer before he continued on his sales pitch. &quot;It has a boring title, or a slow start that makes people drop it before it cocoons and becomes a swan.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Ooh!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I love that analogy! You used two well known metaphors for change, and by making the Swan the final product, it leaves no room for doubt that the change was a growth in character!&quot; He nodded, mulling the phrase over in his head. The praise he gave was no less than his true thoughts about what he heard. I liked that about him. It might be easy to mistake his eccentricity for strangeness or theatre, but I could only interpret it as one of the truest sources of warmth and kindness in my life. &quot;Well, you took two out of the three reasons I had thought of for a book being left untouched on a shelf. I doubt I'd be able to describe it as eloquently as you, but I'll try. The other thing that can be off-putting is that it's ahead of its time.&quot; By this point he was so leaned forward that our faces were mere inches from each other.</p> <p>He leaned back and put on another frown, this time demonstrating contemplation. &quot;Ahead of its time. What does that mean, I wonder. Was it a time traveller? Was it too frank for the politics of the decade? Well, I hope I haven't dragged out the story for you. If you're to remember anything from my rambling, it's that it'll be different from anything you've read before.&quot;</p> <p>I nodded, all thoughts of my previous nihilism - or was it just depression - out of my mind. I stood up, aiming to go to the till, but Melon stood up and prevented me from doing so. &quot;Don't go and pay for it yet!&quot; he said. &quot;What if it's really bad? Then it'll be my fault for overselling it to you! Just take it with you and tell me if my monologue had any basis in truth, ok?&quot;</p> <p>Once again, I couldn't do anything but smile at the radiance he emanated. I thanked him and left the shop, awkwardly putting the book into the bag. I really hope I don't look suspicious doing this. I continued on my journey, although I'm not sure what that journey may be. I made my way into the intersection near the centre of the shopping area and looked up at the clock that was placed scarily high up. I always feel for the builders who do things up high. I definitely wouldn't be able to stomach it. I already have to convince myself I won't fall out of my bedroom window whenever I look outside. The clock informed me that, surprisingly, it was not even near noon, as I had expected. There was still a lot of the day left, and I had no plans.</p> <p>I must have looked lost or unconfident, because out of nowhere, an arm went over my shoulder and a palm over my eyes. I was led slowly in a direction that felt uphill. I broke into a smile and put my hands over the one covering my eyes, expecting little resistance. To my shock, it didn't budge. &quot;Come on nihxl, let me see!&quot; Finally, the hand left my face, and what I saw was not the classmate who was generally regarded as the class clown who was never mean-spirited to anyone, but the face of a man much older than myself, looking forward with a slight grin on his face. I tried to force my way out, but the hand on my shoulder dug even deeper, his fingers now crawling into the uncomfortable gap somewhere next to my collarbone. I exhaled from the pain, and my eyes instinctively started to water. I kept trying to wriggle, and looked around for the support of a stranger, but to my left, the opposite side of the man, was a woman who could quite clearly see what was happening, but decided to ignore it.</p> <p>At that moment, it was set in my heart that bystanders were in fact perpetrators, although, as it came to my attention only a few seconds later, she was no mere pedestrian, enjoying the path laid out for her, but in fact an acquaintance of the one currently with an arm around my neck.</p> <p>&quot;Come on Alex, stop being weird and walk properly,&quot; the woman said with a feigned kindness so precise and scathing it was as if an actual scalpel had escaped her tongue and was now sliding across my body, cutting to the bone with the precision of a surgeon but leaving no mark for the outside the see. The frustration I felt doubled up the tears leaking from my eyes. I hated myself for not being able to do a thing. I was even numbing to the pain from the fingers impaling my collarbone. Was this the limit of my resolve? Was all it took to take me somewhere far away a little pain and a friend?</p> <p>I just walked, tears streaming from my eyes. I must've looked like a child who was disappointed that the clown at the circus didn't wave at him when it did to other children. Honestly. I was almost eighteen and the best metaphor I had for myself was a toddler.</p> <p>I'm so pathetic.</p> <h2 id="chapter-2"><a href="#chapter-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 2</h2> <p>I just took step after step. I made no resistance against these people who were going to take me far, far away. Heh. It makes it sound dreamlike when I use that phrasing. Dreamlike.. Because I want it to end and for me to wake up at home and know I was never really in danger? Or because of some other, unknown reason. Maybe deep within my mind, so deep I would never be aware of it, I actually want to leave this place so badly I don't care about the circumstances I might be in after. There were no police officers anywhere in sight. Was this fate? Was it my destiny to be taken away into the unknown where I know nobody and nobody cares for me? I wonder, if there actually was a police officer, would I have had the resolve to actually grab their attention.</p> <p>To the outside world, I looked like a snivelling boy who couldn't grow up. I was making an embarrassment of these parents who looked at me with kindness and patience. These upstanding citizens who radiated parenthood as if this was the only thing for them ever since they were born. That's right. To the outside world, everything looks right. Nothing can be wrong because that would harm our states of mind. Imagine if humans were truly empathetic for what happened to everyone around them. This world would've gone nowhere. Maybe there were people like that, but they can't live long. They must either be manipulated until they lose the one trait that made them greater than a human could ever be, or they simply can't survive in such a cruel world.</p> <p>What a clichéd term. &quot;Cruel world.&quot; What does that even mean? Is it the world that's cruel? Is it humans? Is it just a complaint made by those too weak to even save themselves? Do I really need someone to save me?</p> <p>As if to answer that final question, pitying my lack of willpower - to say it was rubbing salt in a wound was not enough. This was an insult to my very existence. - the figures that were to dictate my future had stopped. I looked forward, trying to figure out what could've made these two people, that I associated with absolute and unshakeable evil, stop in their tracks.</p> <p>It was a boy.</p> <p>I say boy. He was at an age where he was expected to be an adult, yet not. He was starting to have a feel for where life was going to take him, but not really. He almost knew everything around him, but not quite.</p> <p>That's right.</p> <p>He was seventeen. The same age as myself.</p> <p>His name is Famskiis. He goes to the same school as me. Actually, he's in quite a few of my classes. I'm not sure what his personality really is. Whether it be because I'm not close enough with him or because he truly is an enigma, I don't know. And yet, he was standing in front of me, who was standing between two people, who were to anyone else my parents. I tried to remember all that I could about him, and while I did that, conversation unfolded around me.</p> <p>The woman on my left spoke first. &quot;Hello boy. I'd hope you wouldn't get in the way of our journey here-&quot;</p> <p>I guess it was a little premature to call it a conversation. Within moments, Famskiis was right next to the woman. He ducked down and swung his leg, one arm on the ground behind him in order to retain his balance. The woman dropped like a boulder sinking in water. There was no pretty effect as she did so though. She slammed into the ground, hard.</p> <p>Famskiis wasted no time, swiftly raising himself back to full height, lifting his leg and sending it down with so much force that I was sure the audible crack was from the woman's spine and not some coincidental leaf.</p> <p>By this point, the man had left go of me and went towards the significantly shorter and leaner Famskiis, but this didn't seem to faze him. In fact, Famskiis looked completely in his element. He lifted up the near-unconscious woman off the ground and started using her as some sort of human shield, sending her fist forward like some sort of puppeted punch.</p> <p>The man, filled with newfound compassion that he conveniently lacked when he was taking me to the depths of hell, didn't seem to want to hit the girl. Nor did he expect the next strike Famskiis did. Famskiis cleanly dropped the woman, diverting the man's attention before sidestepping closer to him and landing an elbow deep into his cheek. The man staggered back, holding his hand against his cheek. He used this new distance to readjust his stance. He raised his other arm so that it looked someone reminiscent of a boxer. However, it didn't take an expert to tell he was over-guarding the pain he felt in his cheek. Famskiis pinpointed this instantly and went once again to the already-injured side, knowing that any move the man could make would be slower.</p> <p>Famskiis closed in monstrously quickly, leading in with his right fist. I allowed myself a moment to ponder whether he might be left-handed. However, my apparent safety didn't last long. The man, although not the best boxer, had the intuition to use more than just his fists. He brought his knee up and raised his foot towards to the already advancing Famskiis, sending his shoe into Famskiis' belly, squeezing his diaphragm with so much force that Famskiis doubled over, giving the man a chance to follow this with a right hook that sent Famskiis flying across the pavement.</p> <p>The man looked over at me with a grin, and I saw a dangerous glint in his eyes. He reached into his back pocket and took out a spiked ring, all while maintaining eye contact with me. His intimidation attempt was successful. I found myself breathing heavily just from imagining the pain of any one of his punches. I looked over towards Famskiis and saw him slowly and clumsily getting up. The previous punch hit Famskiis right on the temple, so getting out of that without being a little concussed was nigh-impossible. After what felt like an eternity, he was on his feet, although he didn't seem confident in his body whatsoever. He balled his hands into fists so tightly his knuckles were beginning to turn white and he charged towards the man.</p> <p>It took no effort for the man to punch Famskiis again. Well, I guess there was some effort. He definitely angled his punch in such a way that the ring made contact. He had punched downwards, taking advantage of the difference in height. His fist landed on Famskiis' shoulder, the ring slicing across his neck as it reached its target.</p> <p>Famskiis was launched towards the floor, but he had a determination within him that I could not pinpoint. It was that same determination that made him stop two people and his classmate in the street and start fighting them with no restraint. Famskiis brought his arm around one of the man's shins, and after landing on the ground, he used his legs and remaining arm to launch himself back up with an almighty twist, lifting the man's leg off the ground. Using this momentum, he brought his legs around and caught the man's other leg, kicking at the kneecap and hooking around the ankle in one swift movement, sending the man to the concrete floor just as he had with the woman.</p> <p>However, the fight was not over yet.</p> <p>The man, despite having crashed into the ground so hard there must be cracks in the paving, brought his fist up and punched into Famskiis' torso. Famskiis took the hit, so the man punched again, and again, and again, and again until there was no doubt that it wasn't just going to leave a bruise. Famskiis' overall stature loosened, and the man used this opportunity to flip the two around so that Famskiis was now the one lying on the ground, gasping for air. With the last of his energy, Famskiis brought his head upwards and headbutted the man right on the nose. However, this had no effect but to enrage him further.</p> <p>The man brought up the hand with the spiked ring, balled one, two, three, four fingers and neatly placed his thumb along them. He sent it downwards and into Famskiis' face. Famskiis was definitely still conscious. He felt that pain in his face in its entirety. His legs even spasmed as they reacted to this source of danger. The man did it again, even harder. As if he was gaining momentum, every strike he did was stronger and faster, and Famskiis' life was slipping away.</p> <p>Inexplicably, I moved. I ran towards the pair and extended my leg into the man's head. I don't trust my physical prowess. I'm not sure I've ever won an arm wrestling contest, even against someone significantly younger than me. There was no way I could win against this person. And yet, with tears streaming and drying on my face and snot leaking just as liberally, I was on my feet and kicking a man who was about to kill an actual fighter for a reason I couldn't comprehend. Or maybe there was no reason. Who knows. I was kicking him. It felt as futile as a worm wanting to fly. Although, I guess some worms do experience flight. They're captured in a bird's beak, and they fly. Their life's dream given to them in such a cruel way.</p> <p>Ah, I said it again. Life being cruel. A &quot;cruel world.&quot; I think back to a famous story I read a while back. The Monkey's Paw. How wishes can be distorted. It feels like it's something that can only happen in fiction, or only very rarely in life, and yet, if this truly is a cruel world, it might be the only way wishes come true. The worm who flew in the beak of a bird. Maybe that's how my life will go.</p> <p>And yet, I was on my feet. Well. I was on one of them. The other was currently making contact with the head of the man in front of me. I lost my balance and fell on top of Famskiis, hurting him even more. It truly is fate. People say the sky is the limit. I think I know why. Because once you overstep your boundaries. Not the ones you set yourself, but the boundaries of your very existence. Once you break the limit of your very existence, there is no way to retain that existence. You're enveloped by the vastness and cruelty of space. A worm isn't meant to fly. The sky is the limit. I was crushing a dying man who wanted to save me.</p> <p>How pathetic.</p> <p>I'm sure, had I the chance, I would've cried more. The pity I had for myself was boundless. But, I had another, much crueler thing in front of me.</p> <p>I got to my feet, definitely hurting Famskiis more in the process and I sprang headfirst towards the man who was now squatted on the ground, trying to reorient himself. I thrust my arms around his neck and once again using my legs to throw my body forward, taking him with me. I used the movement to throw him away from myself, sending the back of his head into the pavement with a satisfying crunch. With the desperation of a cornered fox, I jumped up on top of him and grabbed his head, repeating the movement of rocking his head forward and pushing it into the concrete floor, all while tears streamed from my eyes.</p> <p>I kept on doing it, cruelly. Was I now the reason the world was cruel? Is cruelty in this world a cycle of pain towards others? Did this man deserve pain? Did he deserve deat-</p> <p>I stopped. I looked down at who was below me and saw a lifeless face. I turned his head around and jumped back at the sheer amount of blood, both dried and freely streaming from an opening in his head. I screamed. It wasn't a pretty scream. I'm not sure it even was a scream. It may as well have been a gargle or a cough or a gag.</p> <p>It doesn't matter. My mouth made some sound, and I vomited. I fell to the ground, tears in my eyes, and coughed up the content of the my stomach, wallowing. I'm not sure what I was wallowing in. Maybe just the sick. Maybe the cruelty. Or the sadness. I just wallowed. I don't know how long it was, but a lot of time must have passed.</p> <p>I don't know when I passed out, but I must have, as I came to into a slight hubbub. I remembered about Famskiis and tried to sit straight up, but something restricted me. I took in my surroundings and realised that I was in a hospital bed.</p> <h2 id="chapter-3"><a href="#chapter-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 3</h2> <p>I watched the activities of the people around me. It was a fairly large ward, which made me think that I wasn't in need of any drastic treatment. It made sense, seeing as I so bravely allowed Famskiis to take my hits. Where was Famskiis? There's no way he would be in a ward like this, he was practically half dead. I'm glad I'm in a hospital though. It meant someone took notice of us and realised the fight was over. Maybe it was actually so quick that police found us straight after I passed out. Regardless of what that outcome might have been, I didn't feel any need to be here.</p> <p>I called towards one of the nurses and waited for them to attend to me. &quot;Where's the person who was with me?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Which one? There were three people who came along with you.&quot;</p> <p>Oh. Of course. No matter what circumstances might have been. No matter how evil the pair might seem to be, it's a doctor's responsibility to save everyone they can.</p> <p>&quot;Any of them, but I'm most interested in the one that was my age.&quot;</p> <p>The nurse cocked her head to the side slightly, indicating that one of the answers was in that direction. I followed her yellow brick road and saw the woman who was knocked down early on in the fight, happily chatting with one of the nurses with the same sickly sweetness she had used earlier.</p> <p>Any relief I might have felt due to one less serious casualty diffused instantly. Once again, she was the epitome of evil in my mind. How could she just pretend that life went on? As if both her friend and someone else weren't hurt?</p> <p>&quot;And the other two?&quot;</p> <p>The anger in my throat must have made its way into either my voice or my face, because she answered shortly. &quot;You'll find out soon, I expect. Focus on your own recovery.&quot;</p> <p>I laid back down stubbornly. Now that I was awake, I had no desire to go back to sleep. Not that my thoughts would let me. The other two were most likely in the ICU. The nurse mentioned that there were three people who came in with me. I doubt they'd send a dead person into a hospital, which meant the man wasn't dead. My mind raced with thoughts and theories, trying to imagine how their recoveries might be going. I tried to block out the unfiltered malevolence in the room I was in, but it wasn't as successful as I had hoped.</p> <p>Contrary to my aforementioned determination, I must have fallen asleep. I know that I'm asleep because I'm now in a courtroom.</p> <p>Well, I say courtroom. It's one of those really over-dramaticised ones. There's a looming figure who must be the judge, there are spotlights on me and that tall wooden structure and darkness encompassed everything else. What a generic nightmare. And yes, it is a nightmare. I look up at the judge, and see a snake slithering its way around the judge's robes, coming to a rest next to its ear. It may be a snake, but I instantly know who it is. That snake is the man who attacked me. The one who almost killed Famskiis. At least, I hope it was only almost.</p> <p>It whispered into the judge's ear, as snakes do, and instantly I saw his face contort. Suddenly, the darkness filled up with an image. It was the back of the man's head, leaking red. Not just from the one spot, as it had been in reality, but from all over. As I turned around, it got more and more detailed, the dream becoming more and more vivid. In each subsequent image, the head turned around slightly more. Until, at the final image, directly above me, it was facing towards me perfectly. Its eyes weren't there. They were simply orifices from which blood poured out. It wasn't cheap, light red movie blood. This was the head of course, we weren't going to have thin blood at the one most important thing in our bodies. It was a deep, viscous and dark red that poured down onto my shoulders and started filling up from the floor, until I was floating on the surface, spread-eagled. I was truly vulnerable.</p> <p>Slowly, the holes that leaked blood distorted. They began to fill with teeth, until every nostril, eye socket and ear canal was a carbon copy of this man's mouth. It closed its mouth, ready to bellow.</p> <p>Contrary to my expectations, it spoke normally. However, the power it held over me meant his apparent volume made no difference. Maybe it looked like it whispered, but he may as well have bellowed.</p> <p>&quot;GUILTY&quot;</p> <p>The words shattered through my mind and I was submerged into the lake of blood. I thought I was going to hit the bottom so hard that my skull would crack open, just like his did. However, there was no bottom. Before I realised it, I was careering through darkness. I had no control over my direction. My only path was down. Was it down anymore? It didn't matter. Finally, I hit a surface so hard that every vertebra in my spine screeched more tonelessly than a banshee, and I awoke, thrusting my torso forward so much that my back made a perfect arch.</p> <p>My forehead was cold with sweat and my breath was so staggered I'm not sure if I was actually inhaling any oxygen. I can't stay here anymore. Especially not with that thing sleeping in the same room as me. I'm not safe here. Let me out. Let me out let me out let me out let me out let me out let me out please please please let me out I can't do this LET ME GO!</p> <p>I guess I'm lucky my muscles were too fatigued to move. If any of those thoughts were brought to the surface in any way I doubt I'd be let out of any institution for a great portion of my life.</p> <p>I got the attention of a nurse. The same one as last time. I asked how long it might be since I could be let out. She said that I seemed uninjured from whatever happened to the four of us, so there wasn't really a need to keep me.</p> <p>A couple hours later, I was finally set free from the hospital, and made my way home. Thankfully - although I guess it shouldn't be a priority - the paramedics had also brought anything that they thought belonged to us with them on the ambulance so I had my bag,  with all its contents, on me as I left the place. It was fairly late in the afternoon by the time I got home. To think I was going to go to the park or something. This definitely wasn't how I expected the day to turn out. There was nothing I could really do. I wasn't in the mood for reading, nor in the mood for TV. I just felt sick. It's strange how something can ruin your day so much.</p> <p>I simply laid myself down on the sofa, taking care not to agitate my digestive system even further, and tried to rest. I didn't dare let myself sleep though. Actually. Could I even sleep tonight? I was getting nightmares in the day, for crying out loud! Thirsty. A little hungry. I didn't move though. I may not have been physically injured in any of that, but my body was so battered. I didn't want to move.</p> <p>My complaints about my body reminded me of Famskiis. If my mental state was like this, with a near-perfect outcome physically, I couldn't even begin to imagine what Famskiis might be going through. I hope he's asleep.</p> <p>God I'm disgusting.</p> <p>He fought for me and nearly killed himself and I'm acting traumatised. As if anything happened to me. The only consolation my mind could give was basically that he was injured enough that he wouldn't wake up for a lot longer. I was basically asking him to die so that he wouldn't feel any more pain.</p> <p>I don't care if euthanasia is a topic of frequent ethical debates. In this context, it was no less than the excuse scum gives to pretend it has empathy.</p> <p>I punched the sofa, but that didn't relieve any stress. My only option was to continue waiting there - waiting for what, I didn't know - and hope that my thoughts didn't turn completely grey.</p> <p>I guess I fell asleep, thankfully undisturbed, as I awoke at four in the morning in a slight damp state. For some reason, whenever I sleep at a time that isn't what one would normally consider healthy, I sweat tons. My brain was already waking up, so I knew there was no point in laying in bed.</p> <p>I slowly pushed myself off of the sofa and went into the shower, sluggishly getting the shampoo and shower gel out of the cupboard. Once undressed, I went to turn the valve, but after everything that had happened, I needed a bath. I moved the valve that made water come out of the waterfall tap that used to dazzle me when I was younger and allowed the bath water to fill up slightly.</p> <p>Once it was deep enough for me to fully submerge my legs, I tested the temperature and fiddled with the taps until it reached a point that I wouldn't get third degree burns. I climbed in and instantly fell into the seductive arms of relaxation. I stretched my back and heard an audible click that, while sounding extremely unhealthy, gave me a real sense of relief. Slowly but surely, I could fell my stress slipping away slightly. It's not insensitive. Humans are just made that way. If it was in my mind all the time, I wouldn't be able to function. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget the experience, but I can't let it weigh me down constantly.</p> <p>Once I got out, I had about an hour and a half left before I had to go to school. I spent some time procrastinating on my phone before I realised that half that time had already passed. I packed my bag and put on my clothes, dried my hair and blew my nose. There was about ten minutes left so I decided to just leave the house early. I grabbed a breakfast on the way and arrived at school. I went to where I always did when there was some spare time: outside the locker next to the main building.</p> <p>I felt the conversation go quiet around me and I knew that rumours had already begun to spread. This soured my mood instantly, which in actuality would probably make them travel with even more diligence. I decided to leave the group and walk on my own for a bit. I guess I must've looked lost or unconfident, because out of nowhere, an arm went over my shoulder and a palm went over my eyes. I started hyperventilating. How could he have found my school? He was basically half dead! You don't recover from something like that overnight!</p> <p>Once it sensed my panic, this hand, unlike the previous one, retracted. I turned around and saw someone I mentioned earlier: nihxl.</p> <p>&quot;Yo,&quot; he said, raising an open palm as a form of greeting. &quot;Everyone's saying you were in some sort of fight. I didn't think it was true, but I guess you've got some spirit in there after all.&quot; He dropped the jokey manner after this. I guess that opening was his way of showing that nothing would change. &quot;It was bad, huh? You started shaking like you were being electrocuted just from me covering your eyes.&quot;</p> <p>I mentioned it earlier, but no matter how comedic nihxl ever was, he was never mean-spirited. That trait of his now shone the brightest I've ever seen. He managed to put so much care into the words he chose that you would never feel ashamed for what you had said or done or even experienced. It was truly a golden personality.</p> <p>I simply nodded, and somehow, he knew exactly how long to wait before continuing.</p> <p>&quot;You're not someone who gets afraid, so I'm not going to treat this as some overreaction to a minor incident. Don't be afraid to talk to someone. Telling just one person can help you in ways you wouldn't know until you've done it.&quot;</p> <p>Honestly. I keep repeating how amazing he is, but he seems to constantly top it. What he said was basic. Anyone could have said it. However, he sought me out and decided, for no reason other than to help me, reminded me that I shouldn't keep things bottled up. Yes. I am afraid.</p> <p>Thank you for noticing.</p> <h2 id="chapter-4"><a href="#chapter-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 4</h2> <p>It's sad how mental health isn't talked about. Even admitting to pain that is more than a fleeting punch on the arm gets me uncomfortable. If I can barely talk about my physical pain without cringing at my own weakness, how could I even begin to discuss any hurt I may have on the inside?</p> <p>And yet, it was so appealing, and I had an outlet right here. 'Outlet.' What a selfish term for someone willing to help me. I wonder if I'm actually a selfish person, or whether everyone has slight thoughts. Do thoughts make a person selfish, or is it what they do with those thoughts that dictates their morality?</p> <p>&quot;Famskiis is in the hospital because of me,&quot; I began. I didn't continue because nihxl had his arm outstretched, signalling me to stop.</p> <p>&quot;Wallowing doesn't help, and blaming yourself won't make you feel better. This is meant to be for you relief, not so that you can pity yourself more. I imagine you've done enough of that by now.&quot;</p> <p>I blinked. I didn't expect him to take control of the conversation so swiftly. He was right though. I nodded and told nihxl what happened, less emotionally this time.</p> <p>He didn't interrupt me during the retelling. It's good that he didn't. If he did, I'm not sure I would've continued talking. I was still embarrassed. Embarrassed of such a thing even happening to me. Embarrassed that not just one, but now two of my classmates were in some way involved. Although, judging by how quiet everyone got earlier, it's no longer just two classmates.</p> <p>I laboured through the day slowly. It's weird. Even though lesson time felt significantly longer, as if time itself was being stretched and pulled along a planet-sized canvas, I remembered almost nothing from the day. It's not like I spent that time thinking or anything along those lines. It was as simple as that nothing I was hearing was entering my brain. I'm not sure I could remember even a single word that was said to or by, lesson-related or not.</p> <p>I made my way towards home, but realised that once I got there, I would be no more productive than I had been the day before, so I decided to go the shopping centre about half an hour away from school.</p> <p>My school was in a fairly rich area of town and that affluence carried over to the shops. The shopping centre was massive, harbouring halls of famous brands, knowing they'll sell basic clothes because it has letters printed on it. I took some time to think about how the modern application of capitalism has really failed. Supposedly, it's the people who decide whether something has value and yet, we leave that decision to the very people who want to make as much money as they can out of us. Truly a backwards system. I walked around the complex for a while, remembering all the stores this place had to offer and making a mental note of any shops I took an interest in.</p> <p>After a while of walking around, I sat down on the third - and highest - floor, on a bench next to a collection of bonsai trees. To my left was a restaurant that sold Asian food, and to my right was a cinema. Surprisingly for a school day, there was actually a fairly impressive queue building up. As I looked back to my front, I sensed a presence from the corner of my eye and my heart jumped out of my mouth. My nerves weren't helped by the fact that I was looking over the railing down three floors only a few moments before.</p> <p>I identified the person sitting next to me as Wafflez. Also someone who went to my school, but he was a year younger than me. We only know each other because of the fact that both our cousins are part of the same theatre group. I went to attend one of the shows and saw someone I mildly recognised. I saw him at school the day after and asked him just to make sure I wasn't going crazy and somehow, we started talking.</p> <p>&quot;Hey,&quot; he said after a palpable silence that had somehow nested itself between us. He had brought his knees up to his chest and locked them there by wrapping his arms around, curling up into a ball on a fake wooden bench. I must've had a look on his face, because he instantly began to defend himself.</p> <p>&quot;What? It's comfortable to me, ok!&quot; he said. I laughed. Not because of the actual words he said, but the sheer amount of emotion and effort he put into his face and arms while saying that, while his legs were completely stationary. If I had to compare it to something, he looked like someone trying to imitate an octopus using only their upper body. It was like the energy that would've been used on his legs went to his face, making him gesticulate with so much force there was no way you wouldn't feel even slightly convinced he was telling the truth, no matter what he might be saying.</p> <p>I raised my hands up in a conceding gesture. &quot;Ok,&quot; I said, admitting that there might be truth in his statement. He leaned back, satisfied in my response and once again neatly placed his arms along his knees.</p> <p>&quot;So, what brings you to a shopping centre on a school day?&quot; he asked.</p> <p>I raised an eyebrow. Wasn't he also in a shopping centre on a school day? He tilted his head in response, agreeing that his question was a funny one. Regardless, I answered. &quot;Escaping the monotony of life at school and at home, I guess.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Ahhh,&quot; he nodded thoughtfully. &quot;Spending money in the hopes that your chronic existential crises disappear at least a little in the face of material desires. An admirable notion, if not a generic one.&quot;</p> <p>Look at that. Another person noticing my hardship and making me feel better. Was I ever this kind to any of these people?</p> <p>&quot;So, what's piqued your interest so far?&quot;</p> <p>In the few shops that I went to, there was one thing that stood out among the rest. Not because it was new. Buying something new when old products are the exact same quality but slightly older components that might it marginally worse is a terrible thing to do. Personally, I had a flagship phone from three years ago. I bought it about half a year ago new, which means that I don't suffer like people on the Internet may want to make you believe in order to justify their own bad spending habits. What carved its pedestal, high above the rest in my mind, was the fact that it was a creation so useful, thoughtful and considerate that I wanted to meet the maker just to thank them and wonder what kind of marvellous mind might make a product like this.</p> <p>It was a bottle that told you how much you should drink by certain times in the day.</p> <p>Wafflez responded with a deflated &quot;oh&quot;. I'm not sure why he looked like he expected more. None of my praise was misplaced and nor was it an overstatement in any way.</p> <p>As someone who forgets to drink water a lot, something I don't doubt is as uncommon as you might think, this item would literally improve my health. For so cheap as well!</p> <p>&quot;Right... Anything else?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Nothing as exciting. I was also thinking of getting a couple games.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Mhm. Sounds like you haven't fully inspected this place.&quot;</p> <p>Hmm? What does that mean?</p> <p>He clarified. &quot;There's a new record shop. It's not just old music they sell. They've got some kind of initiative where they help local musicians. I'm pretty sure they've also got a stage there for live performances. It may as well be a jazz bar that sells records.&quot;</p> <p>I nodded, frowning in approval. &quot;Seems good. Not today though. I'm tired and it's already getting dark.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Do you want to spend some time in the park then?&quot; he said surprisingly quickly, as if he was waiting for me to say I needed to leave. I shrugged my shoulders. I saw no problem with spending some more time outside. Especially now that I was going to be with someone else.</p> <p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p> <p>There was a park directly next to the shopping centre, so I didn't have to worry about it getting dark on the way. We went there after I bought the genius water bottle and the few games, refusing Wafflez' nonplussing insistence to pay for at least part of it. First, we spent some time on the swings. Ever since I was small, swings were top tier playground equipment. We didn't do the 'stereotypical teenager thing' that our parents had always disapproved of: swinging hard enough that we went over and around the top bar. For the record though, I got higher than he did.</p> <p>Next, per Wafflez' idea, we started doing trust falls. The faller stood on a weird beam with springs on it. I guess it was meant to make you train your balance. It was pretty simple for anyone over the age of seven though. We sure came up with stupid ideas. I said before that I'm weak, and since it wasn't even a regular trust fall - we were falling from about two feet up from the ground! - I had no clue how I managed to catch him more than once. It was thrilling, falling backwards. There was about a full second where you were just in free fall, before you were caught in the other person's arms. Well, it felt like a second. Maybe my body was preparing to flash my life before my eyes, but it was cut off by Wafflez saving it every time.</p> <p>After that, the aftereffects of our adrenaline production took course, and we were too exhausted to mess around on any more playground things. We went to the small lake in the park that somehow stayed preserved so close to an urban area. My favourite thing about the lake was that it had areas of pure trees with a few benches as well, so it wasn't uncomfortable or inconvenient to be there.</p> <p>We walked over to a bench that was located at the end of a jut inwards into the lake. Trees lined the path behind us and surrounded our left and right sides. To our front was a large part of the lake, small islands lined with trees looking like polka dots on the water. The sun was beginning to set in the East. We sat down on the bench, looking onwards and watching the rays of light break up along the horizon, making the water gleam and, as leaves peacefully made their ways downward and insects lived their lives across the lake, the water rippled and curved, reflecting colours and making a pattern no kaleidoscope could ever emulate. I looked to my right and saw that Wafflez was sitting just as he was before: knees against his chest with his arms locked around them. He looked so tranquil. I turned my head back and saw a painting more beautiful than anything Da Vinci could have made. The sun was half-hidden behind the network of branches and leaves, thrusting a myriad of colours into the canvas that was the sky. They blended and faded together in a way so much prettier than a mere reflection on water could make. Suddenly, I felt a slight weight on my right shoulder, causing me to jump a little. I turned my head to the source and saw Wafflez resting his head on my shoulder, eyes closed. I decided not to resist in any way. How could I? He was a person who showed me utter kindness. Also, he looked so innocent there that I felt I would be ripping something away from him if I budged even an inch. I leaned back slightly, attempting to make my shoulder a more comfortable place to rest, and watched the sun creep its way below the horizon, the colours it created turn slowly more purple, then blue, then finally, black.</p> <p>After what felt like an eternity, I broke the silence. &quot;It's really dark now. We should be getting home.&quot;</p> <p>No response.</p> <p>I looked over to him and saw that he was asleep. He looked even cuter asleep. I shook him and, slowly, he awoke. Once again, I said that we should be getting home.</p> <p>He replied a bit awkwardly. &quot;Hehe. To be honest, Cousland, my house is a bit strained right now. A lot of them are going through some vital point in their lives and for the past couple days they've been letting out their stress on me - not physically, of course! They've just been a bit on edge. I guess, what I want to say is.. can I spend the night at your place?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Can't you ask a friend that's your age?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;There's not really anyone else at school that I feel comfortable sharing it with.. and anyway, I'm sure they're preparing to go to sleep by now, if they aren't already.&quot;</p> <p>I agreed, under the condition that he would start sleeping at home the moment it gets easier, and that he would tell his parents where he is. No matter how much stress they're under, not knowing where their son is will only complicate things further.</p> <p>We went back to my house. I prepared some food for the both of us. Wafflez wanted to take a shower, so we went to our room to find some clean clothes for him while he was done. However, when I went to the door, there was a light coming from inside.</p> <p>We opened the door and saw a boy a year older than me.</p> <p>&quot;Hey you two! Wow.. Is that Wafflez? I haven't seen you in ages!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What are you doing here?! How did you get in?&quot; I demanded.</p> <p>&quot;I'll answer one of those questions,&quot; he said while turning back to what he was doing before. &quot;I was going through your search history.&quot; He turned his head towards Wafflez. &quot;You know. While he doesn't have CBBE, he does have schlongs of skyrim, so I suggest you watch yourself while taking that shower. Although..&quot; he paused to do what looked like analyse us. &quot;.. It seems like you're actually in luck that way.&quot;</p> <h2 id="chapter-5"><a href="#chapter-5" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 5</h2> <p>Our home invader was none other than my older cousin, Ace. He was, in fact, the cousin I had mentioned earlier: the one who brought Wafflez and I together through theatre. As you can see, he has zero respect for privacy! He even had the audacity to say something weird in front of a visitor!</p> <p>&quot;How did you even unlock my computer?&quot; I demanded.</p> <p>&quot;Oh please,&quot; he said while waving a hand. &quot;You've used the same password since you were eight. The most ambitious variation you've ever done is add a one at the end.&quot;</p> <p>I bit my lip. For being part of a generation that grew up with computers, I should really get into the habit of being safe on them.</p> <p>I turned to Wafflez. &quot;For the record, he's lying about what he just said. I do have CBBE on my skyrim save.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Notice how he didn't deny having Schlongs of Skyrim!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It's to be equal! Nothing more and nothing less!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Is that why your character has a horse cock that goes down to his knees?&quot; Ace responded, raising an eyebrow.</p> <p>&quot;You went on my save as well?!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Ah, so you're openly admitting to it?&quot;</p> <p>I grinded my teeth against each other. He had well and truly trapped me. Out of nowhere, Wafflez started to laugh.</p> <p>&quot;Good to see you again, Ace. I see you still have your unique charm. So Cousland, let's retrieve what we initially came here for.&quot;</p> <p>Oh yeah. I went to my wardrobe and picked out a plain black shirt and some shorts. I also passed him slippers, in case he was a slipper kind of person. He took them over to the bathroom and proceeded to take a shower.</p> <p>&quot;He's really cute now, isn't he?&quot; Ace said, causing me to do a double take.</p> <p>&quot;Compared to what?&quot; I replied tentatively.</p> <p>He took a moment to contemplate. &quot;Hm... Objective standards,&quot; he finally said, making it clear that there was not even the shadow of a doubt that he thought Wafflez was cute by all definitions and standards of the term.</p> <p>&quot;I've never really thought of that. I've not really thought of him in that way, at all.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Woah woah. I suggest you keep your voice down if you want to keep his feelings from getting hurt. At least act like your feelings are somewhere near mutual!&quot;</p> <p>It's not like I couldn't tell what Ace was implying. It just didn't feel like what he was saying was the truth. Regardless, he said it with such seriousness that I decided not to argue the point further. Instead, I fervently set to work on changing my password to something that wouldn't end up with my modlist being analysed. Then, I realised that I was barely covering it and that Ace was right behind me, seeing every key that was pressed. I imagine he was standing there, waiting for me to realise while he tried his hardest not to giggle.</p> <p>&quot;There are more rooms in this house than just this one, you know,&quot; I finally said, after more discreetly changing my password.</p> <p>&quot;Do you really want me talking to Wafflez outside of your supervision?&quot; he replied slyly.</p> <p>&quot;Ah, not really. You seem like you're in a slanderous mood.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Is it slander if all my statements are true though?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Fine. You're in a defaming of unspecified nature mood.&quot;</p> <p>After about five more minutes, Wafflez came back in the room. His hair was still wet, forming clumps that travelled down his head and curled subtly at the tips. He was quite a bit smaller than me, which meant that the clothes he was currently wearing gave him quite a bit of room to move. To counteract this, he had rolled up the bottom of his t-shirt slightly, balancing the ends perfectly on top of the shorts he wore. It was lucky those shorts had an elastic waist that could be pulled tighter. It was a slight blow to my body image when I saw the strings reaching down to the start of his leg, even after being tied into a knot. He was, in fact, wearing the slippers I gave him, which was probably a good choice as, with his calves so exposed, he'd probably be freezing without them. I expect he would've been too polite to say anything if that were the case.</p> <p>The bagginess made the overall appearance seem quite unkempt, creating a childish look and further reinforcing the cuteness that Ace mentioned, which I found myself unable to disagree with. Speaking of Ace. After I finished my analysis of Wafflez, I saw Ace making a face out of the corner of my eyes. I turned my head to get a clearer view and saw that he was raising his eyebrows like an 11 year old girl would to her friends when she sees a cute guy. I shook my head in disbelief and cleared an area on my bed to sit.</p> <p>I guess I can't do anything with Ace saying something weird. Right as I finished clearing a space on my bed, he saw a perfect opportunity. &quot;Oh my, are you inviting Wafflez into your bed, Cousland? Do you want me to leave, or would you prefer me to join in?&quot; he said, earning a death glare from myself and a snort of laughter from Wafflez.</p> <p>&quot;So,&quot; I said, trying to ignore his risqué comments. &quot;I suggest that we go to sleep and in the morning, we'll see if we can provide better accommodation for Wafflez.&quot;</p> <p>To my horror, Ace suggested that we do some kind of sleepover party style of night. To my terror, Wafflez agreed. Even if this was my house, I had no control over the antics this pair would pull.</p> <p>&quot;What should we start with?&quot; Ace asked, with a look in his eyes that I was in great fear of.</p> <p>Wafflez suggested truth or dare before I even had the chance to intervene with a less problematic game. Then, I heard something even more terrifying.</p> <p>&quot;Let's have Cousland start.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Truth or dare?&quot;</p> <p>How much power a mere question could hold. If I said dare, the pair were sure to make me do some embarrassing thing, possible even including the other in order to make it significantly worse. If I said truth, they would delve into the deepest crevices and gorges of their minds in order to find some question that would leave me with no good answer. Saying that I didn't want to play didn't even cross my mind, and for good reason. Compared to what I suspect they could do, truth or dare was a tame game. If I pick truth, my answer will have to be the truth, so there isn't much for them to twist at my expense. There, that was my decision.</p> <p>&quot;Truth.&quot;</p> <p>With no delay, they started their assault.</p> <p>&quot;Out of the pair of us, which one is hotter?&quot; Ace asked.</p> <p>There's no way I could say my cousin.</p> <p>&quot;Wafflez. You're next Ace. Truth or dare?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Dare,&quot; he said without missing a beat.</p> <p>Just from his response, I could tell he had no goal but to stare as much trouble up as possible. Now that I think about it, the question he asked me was pretty much rigged from the start. He mentioned earlier that I should at least pretend to be somewhat interested in Wafflez, and I don't doubt that my quick response didn't help my case.</p> <p>Onto the matter at hand. I had to give him some kind of dare that, while embarrassing, didn't implicate myself or Wafflez any more than it had to. Probably something like pick a nose or try to lick his armpit. I'll go with the latter.</p> <p>&quot;Lick your armpit.&quot;</p> <p>As soon as I said it, I was filled with regret. I forgot who exactly I was dealing with. This man was someone who managed to turn anything into something inappropriate, and it always seemed to make me the butt of the joke.</p> <p>&quot;Oh my, are you into armpits, Cousland? Take notes, Wafflez,&quot; he said before sticking out his tongue and getting respectably close before retracting his head, complaining of neck pain.</p> <p>&quot;You're next, Wafflez,&quot; he said cheerfully, making me realise how much danger I was in. I needed to come up with something before the question was even asked. I'm sure Ace already has some morally compromising question to ask or dare to do. Or maybe he comes up with this on the spot. In which case, I'm even more scared. It means that it's innate for him to be so... him. If it was a conscious decision to tease me, I might've been slightly more ok with it. However, compelling evidence led me to the other option.</p> <p>As a dare, I could make Wafflez try to 'walk' whilst doing a bridge. He seems flexible enough that he'd be able to do so without hurting himself. The question is a slightly harder topic. I decided on something I was genuinely interested in.</p> <p>&quot;Truth or dare?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Truth.&quot;</p> <p>I put in my question before Wafflez even finished speaking. &quot;Tell us your favourite memory.&quot;</p> <p>Ace pouted, as if to complain that my question was too boring. Wafflez didn't pick up on this, and started to speak.</p> <p>&quot;If I had to choose, it would probably be when I was around eleven. Typical, I know. Someone putting a nostalgic twist on their memories, even if they'd say it was one of the worst days of their life while they're experiencing it. Although, I would say I've got a fairly vivid memory starting at around ten or eleven years old. Some parts definitely stick out more than others as very clear memories. Anyway, so I was eleven and on holiday with my family. We were in Sweden in late January. We were staying in a lodge. It was fairly late in the night. It was completely dark outside and we were all holed up in the living room. My two younger siblings, a sister and a brother, were playing a little with the fireplace under the close eye of my dad in the armchair. My mum was lying across the sofa half-asleep, attempting to read a book, but failing as the hours grew later. Funnily enough, I can't exactly remember where I was in that picture, just that it happened. It was an idyllic scene. I guess that was more of an image than a memory, but I hope that works.&quot;</p> <p>Wow. That image just fills me with nostalgia, and I wasn't even there. It had the same warmth as those Christmas cards that have a snowy cabin in the woods, as if it were hiding some secret away from the depths of the trees. It really is a pacifying thing. Even Ace looked stunned. Wafflez really did a good job of describing the scenery. It was just like a painting.</p> <p>Wafflez broke the silence. &quot;It's your go again, Cousland.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Ah right, tru-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Nope. You have to alternate every time,&quot; Ace intervened, much to my dismay. &quot;Them's the rules,&quot; he said. &quot;Imagine how boring it would be if everyone were to pick a truth every time.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Fine then. I <em>pick</em> dare.&quot;</p> <p>Despite the sass I gave to Ace, I was actually very worried. I couldn't really protest against this rule. There were people who played like that and I doubt the pair would let me get away with a truth every time without having some repercussion.</p> <p>&quot;Kiss Wafflez.&quot;</p> <p>I laughed at the dare, but once I caught Wafflez eyes, I realised that not only was Ace serious, but Wafflez was up for it.</p> <p>I started a weak protest, but Ace cut through it lazily. Reluctantly, I shuffled towards him and sat on my knees, seeing him do the same. &quot;This is just for the dare, ok?&quot; Slowly, he started to lean forward, and I followed him in doing so. He closed his eyes, and I closed mine. I tilted my head. That's what people do in movies, right? I guess, by pure luck, he had tilted his head the opposite way. It probably would've been even more hilarious to Ace if we bumped our heads together. I moved my head slowly, until I could sense Wafflez' soft exhales coming from his nose. I leaned forward more, and I felt my lips meet something soft. Too soft to be real. It was so ephemeral. It could flutter away and be forgotten so easily. By instinct, I raised my arms and put them around him, not willing to let his existence run away. He was too pure to be let go just like that.</p> <p>Our moment was interrupted by Ace. &quot;Easy there lovebirds. This is just a dare after all.&quot;</p> <p>Slowly, I removed my arms and we pulled apart. Wafflez looked into my eyes, even cuter than all those times I had seen him before. His lips were slightly glossier than before, and I could still feel the imprint his lips had left on mine.</p> <p>&quot;I hope you enjoyed my first kiss,&quot; he said to me, turning slightly red and crossing his legs and arms as if to protect himself. Once again, I felt an indescribable urge to just take care of him. Hold him in my arms once more and never let him go. I mentioned that he seemed so fleeting. That he could flutter away and be forgotten so easily. Now, when I saw him, it was as if he had butterfly wings behind him. A butterfly. Something you see once on a trip. It shows you its beauty, and then it flutters away, never to be seen again.</p> <p>&quot;Does that mark the end of our truth or dare session?&quot; Ace asked.</p> <p>Judging by the silence in response, it seemed so.</p> <h2 id="chapter-6"><a href="#chapter-6" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 6</h2> <p>There was a bit of a silence after we played truth or dare. It made sense. What do you follow something like that up with? I went downstairs to get some snacks, as well as break the tension a little, although that might have reinforced it, rather than alleviate it. As I was returning, I realised the massive mistake I made and hurried my pace. I opened the door and, to my relief, found that Ace hadn't somehow corrupted Wafflez. In fact, Wafflez wasn't even in the room.</p> <p>&quot;He said he needed to go to the bathroom,&quot; Ace said, answering my unspoken query.</p> <p>I laid down the snacks on the floor and spread myself out on my bed, feeling sleepiness take its reins over me with surprising speed. I recalled what had happened, touching my lips. I didn't say it, but that was also my first kiss. I went over my thoughts and feelings, trying to collect them. Really, Ace could be so troublesome.</p> <p>After a little while, Wafflez returned from the bathroom with a weird look on his face. It was as if he was trying his hardest to keep it straight. I wonder what kind of face he would be making if he wasn't hiding it. I hope it's a happy one. I'm not sure I could bear seeing someone like him seem sad. A sadness in him would seed a feeling of sorrow in everyone near him. Not because he was a source of negativity, he was, in some kind of weird way, a beacon. Maybe my feelings have shifted though. I'm not sure if I was looking at him the same way as I was before. I'm not even sure if the face I was making was the same one as before. Am I being self-conscious? I simply don't know how I feel.</p> <p>I raised the bowl containing the snacks from the floor, offering them to him, eliciting an interesting face and body language of shyness. For once, I looked towards Ace to try and remove some pressure from the room.</p> <p>Thankfully, he didn't fail to deliver.</p> <p>&quot;So. Now's the stage in our little sleepover in which we watch horror movies. Shall we go for a classic or a more modern one?&quot;</p> <p>I let Wafflez decide, seeing as I don't have much experience with that genre of media. He decided to go for a slightly older one, reasoning that new ones used jumpscares to frighten the audience, rather than provide solid horror stories. &quot;They're shock stories, not horror!&quot;</p> <p>We let Ace find some source of the film, hoping that it was a legal copy, and cooped ourselves up in the living room. Ace instantly took a sofa for himself, leaving me an Wafflez to share on the slightly smaller one. It wasn't cramped, but we certainly didn't have tons of room to move.</p> <p>I noticed that, once again, he sat with his knees up and against his chest. It really puzzled me. I still had no clue how it could feel comfortable. This time, I also saw something else. Those same butterfly wings. They weren't the typical black, dark blue, light blue gradient that were used quite a lot in the media. It was more black throughout, with blotches and spots of colour. Not any specific colour. It seemed there wasn't a colour on the world that didn't have a place, albeit small, on his wings. I could also tell that that darkness wasn't a darkness of malice. It was a darkness of someone who was afraid to shine. Even though he was a butterfly, he still had to grow. Not his physiology. He had to grow outwards and spread his wings.</p> <p>Once again I felt the urge to protect him and this time, I didn't deny that feeling. I moved closer to him and put an arm around his neck, holding him closer towards me. He lowered his head and placed it against my shoulder, just like he had on the park, and the movie started to roll.</p> <p>I'm not a movie connoisseur, especially not in the horror genre, but I could tell what Wafflez meant by older movies having a different feel to newer horrors. Even in trailers I could tell new movies have a focus on gore and jumpscares that stick with you. This movie seemed to care more about the setting. Even though there weren't any jumpscares, there was always a tension so effective that it was debilitating to watch just from the fear that there might be something. I can't deny that I probably half-suffocated Wafflez in my fear. To his credit, or perhaps to my dismay, he didn't actually say anything about it. I wish he would say when he's uncomfortable.</p> <p>Once the credits started, a wave of tiredness swept over me, taking ownership of my muscles and dulling my senses. I imagined that the others were going to be feeling pretty similar, so I designated places to sleep. I was going to offer Wafflez my bed, but decided against it, knowing the kinds of comments I would've been asking for from a particular person. I also didn't trust Ace to be alone with Wafflez, brain-addled by sleepiness or not, so I decided to go with the slightly harder option of everyone using the living room. Being the compassionate host that I was, they both got the sofas and I chose the floor, making it more bearable by bringing my long-neglected sleeping bag out from one of my wardrobes and laying it on the ground, all while adamantly ignoring Ace's giving his permission for me to sleep in the same sofa as him.</p> <p>After this it was pretty quiet. This wasn't one of those sleepovers where you keep telling jokes that leave you laughing so hard that by the end your brain's run out of chemicals that make you find things funny and then go to sleep while that last person is still trying not to giggle. No, there was a unanimous tiredness in the room, which led to a unanimous decision that we would be sleeping until the morning. I decided to check my phone one last time and, for no reason in particular, decided to go on the news app. For no reason in particular, I spent a lot of time scrolling, most likely much to the scorn of the two on either side of me, and read something that cleared my head instantly. Or at least, it made me aware once again if the goings on before my brain shut off for the night.</p> <p>The news article was a very local one. It shows the general area of the city right under the title, and the title was one that grabbed my undivided attention. &quot;1 dead and 3 injured in street fight.&quot; That was a dangerous title. If the journalists had known more this wouldn't have a title like that. Also, one dead? There's only two people that it might be. My heart was already filled far above the brim with dread. I tapped on the article and scanned the words. Why was it filled with so much useless junk? I scrolled and scrolled for what felt like an eternity before my eyes caught their prey. I must've missed the actual information, because what I saw was a quote from some police official. &quot;We will be conducting a thorough investigation on what happened in broad daylight, right in the city centre which led to the death of-&quot;</p> <p>My eyes stopped reading. They refused to see anything to the right of the measly two letter word. I pressed the power button on my phone. I couldn't read any further and there was no point in finding out anyway. The information will still be there tomorrow, and just judging from the situation the man had way heavier injuries. Just as I was trying to finally get to sleep, slowly overcoming my stress-induced insomnia, I heard a mind-shattering sentence from my right.</p> <p>&quot;Wow, apparently someone from our school was attacked on Sunday and he died in the hospital today. Apparently it was on one of the biggest roads in the city.&quot;</p> <p>My heart started to feel like it was taking laps around my body, putting kilograms upon kilograms of weights in each limb it entered. Finally, that weight found its way into my throat, bringing my head down to the ground. I felt jets of vomit rocket their way up my oesophagus, barely being stopped by my quickly-weakening muscles. I tried to get up to go to the bathroom, but when I put my arms on the ground, they didn't have the strength to pull me up. Just as I thought they might finally be able to grant me my mobility, they gave way, bending my elbows into unnatural shapes and slamming my head into the ground. The juices in my throat saw this opportunity and tried to escape from my mouth. I closed my mouth, but it was too late. There was already enough in my mouth and high enough in my throat that I ended up choking, coughing and spluttering even more sick onto the ground. By this point, the other two were aware of the situation and, minus the natural response of &quot;Are you alright?&quot; got a bowl for me to empty my bowels with, as well as a glass of water.</p> <p>No amount of hacking and coughing made the feeling go away, even as my stomach started to feel like a vacuum, void of even a smidge of food or water. After what felt like an eternity of pain, my throat finally decided to show me mercy. I opened my eyes slowly and I was left to revel in the sick only a few centimetres from my nose. Speaking of my nose, the pungent, reeking stench of the contents of my stomach slammed into me like a tsunami, engulfing all my senses in nothing but pure bodily fluids. I'm glad that Ace and Wafflez were starting to pull me up, because if they hadn't, I would now have been slipping and falling face-first into the pile of puke before me.</p> <p>Once I was pulled up, the muscles in my neck finally decided that the contents of my stomach should remain on the inside of my body, leaving me to only watch my two companions get to work, grabbing paper towels and mops. I tried to help, but my feeble legs refused to take any I weight. I noticed a tight dryness on my cheeks. I'm not sure when or even if I started crying, but I guess I must have, since salty tears were streaming and drying on my face. I wonder what the other two were thinking as they cleaned my mess up. Was it that quietness when one of your friends gets in trouble, or were they wondering why I'm so distressed. I'm not some kind of empath. I don't break down crying when I hear about a tragedy on the news. I wonder if they were even coming up with theories. Maybe I was overthinking things simply because I was, at this moment, an invalid.</p> <p>I managed to, albeit with crushing difficulty, push myself up into the sofa. Somehow, by being more upright, my legs started to regain some composure. Slowly, as if each tissue that made up my legs activated one by one, my legs started to feel and be able to push against the ground. It was weak, but it was an improvement to the snivelling mess I was about 10 minutes before. By this time, Ace and Wafflez had cleared all the sick on the floor. The smell decided to overstay its welcome, but apart from that the situation was just about over. The other two, greatly to their credit, sat on either side of me. There was a long silence.</p> <p>It continued for a strangely long time. These were two of the most talkative people I know, and neither of them could find the right things to say. There was no word in our language or any others that could let them even feel like they could say anything to me. I really knew how to kill a mood.</p> <p>Astonishingly, Ace finally mustered up something, probably a dizzying amount of courage, to end the eerie serenity of silence.</p> <p>&quot;Obviously this isn't my place to ask, but how come that news bothered you so much? Every time I asked, you said that you never really got along with people in your year.&quot;</p> <p>It seemed like even saying this much took a massive toll on Ace as he, having finished speaking, slumped back deeper into the sofa, almost looking terrified that what he said might trigger something significantly worse than what had just transpired.</p> <p>I'm not sure why, but it took me quite a while for me to start speaking. Thankfully, the other two didn't say anything during that time. I'm sure that, had they said anything, I would've remained silent until the morning after. Not out of spite. There was no way I felt any kind of contempt or ill-will towards these friends who just cleaned my sick from the floor. I would've remained silent for the same way I would've remained silent when I told my story to nihxl. It was even harder to say it to Ace and Wafflez. Back then, Famskiis was just in the hospital. There was no 'real' consequence. It didn't even feel real then. I'm not sure if it feels real now. This time, when Famskiis was actually gone.</p> <p>&quot;I was in the 'street fight' that happened on Sunday,&quot; I began, earning not a single face of surprise or hate. I guess I was worried for nothing. Or maybe I never expected them to hate me. I was just afraid of once again opening up my fears to the world. &quot;It wasn't even a fight. The two others in it were some kind of kidnappers. They were going to take me somewhere. I didn't even do a thing against it.&quot; Unlike nihxl, these two let me continue with my pity-wallowing. I guess I should give them the courtesy of leaving as many irrelevant details out of the story as possible. &quot;Famskiis, I don't even know. He just came out of nowhere and started attacking the two around me. It was like he could tell I didn't want to be there, even though no one else would assume anything of that kind. It felt like the whole event played through as detailed as an action movie, but I'm sure it lasted the better part of a minute, if not less. He got hurt because I decided it was a respectably good idea to just watch him fight for me. It was only after he got as hurt as he did that I actually did anything. After that, I woke up in the hospital. I passed out. Pretty humiliating, seeing as my biggest injury was the residue of a hand gripping my shoulder.&quot;</p> <p>By this point, my voice was barely more than a croak. I can't imagine what it must have been like to listen to that. About ten minutes ago, vomit was leaving my body. This time, the fluids that chose to evacuate my sorry mess were tears and snot, clogging up my throat and making breathing an increasingly treacherous path for my body to take. I noticed that my body was extremely tense, as if waiting for an answer. To be honest, that kind of body language would be more of a deterrent to what I seek. I leaned backwards into the sofa, wiping my nose on my arm before using the tissues that Wafflez offered me with impressive haste.</p> <p>&quot;I'm not very good at emotional support,&quot; Wafflez started. &quot;I guess I'm the type that tries to find solutions to problems. Not that useful in this situation. Though, I guess. Do you know the names of the two kidnappers?&quot;</p> <p>I shook my head.</p> <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he said with a discouraged look on his face. &quot;Do you think you'd be able to find out their names if you go to the hospital?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Probably not,&quot; Ace answered for me. &quot;There are probably some rules on the protection of their patients' information. Relieving in most cases. Tragic in this one. The best approach would probably be to go to the police station and make a report. The station said they were looking for as much evidence as possible and you're the perfect person. I don't doubt they'll find everyone that was involved soon anyway.&quot;</p> <p>I nodded my head. In a normal situation, I'd probably be surprised that Ace could take something so seriously. I guess I should be thankful that he has an intuition that's greater than mine. This time, I noticed when I started crying. These friends were so kind.</p> <p>I tried to say thank you, but some organ in my throat decided to clog on the way, leaving me to sob uncontrollably while attempting to hug the two. Ace downright refused, but Wafflez allowed me to hug him. I tried to make sure that I didn't get snot or drool onto his shirt, but I'm not sure I entirely succeeded.</p> <p>I didn't sleep peacefully that night, although I think that if they hadn't been so kind to me, my dreams would've been much worse.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
