Theresa May has just resigned. James' future, despite still being bleak, was cast out of his mind as he could see the present in rose-coloured glasses.</p> <p>He took out a sheet of parchment and got his peacock-feather quill, then dipped it in the finest quality ink. He began to write a letter.</p> <p>&quot;Dear Europa,</p> <p>I believe we should rendezvous in order to celebrate the resignation of the fucking bitch Theresa Gay.</p> <p>Meet me at Trafalgar Square at half past noon and we shall celebrate finely.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>James</p> <p>P.S. There is no D in pigeons I consulted the dictionary dumb fuck.&quot;</p> <p>Satisfied, he let the ink dry for about an hour before dipping it in the darkest black tea to get the most authentic effect of age and effort.</p> <p>Carefully, he slotted it into an envelope and slowly licked the glue, feeling his saliva touch every part as it became sticker and sticker on his tongue.</p> <p>He closed it perfectly, the flipped it over, wrote Europa's name and address and then, with extreme diligence, placed the stamp containing the face of our great monarch on the top right corner, perfectly aligned with the paper.</p> <p>He drank the extra tea he made in the kettle, as it was a crime against humanity to waste it, and he left the house.</p> <p>He took the red double-decker bus to Europa's house, commenting on how the Thames was as ugly as ever. Once he reached Europa's placed, he slotted the envelope into the slit for letters.</p> <p>On a normal day, he would've just posted the letter into the red boxes and let the wonderful British postal system do its job, but this was a careful invitation, and it required the utmost care and speed.</p> <p>He returned home and waited for the expected letter.</p> <p>After about half an hour, he heard the tinkle of his mailbox and he stood up from his solid oak chair and went to his door, painted in the colour of the Union Jack on both the inside and outside.</p> <p>He picked up the letter and placed it on his table, grabbing his pure silver and studded gold letter opener from the mantlepiece.</p> <p>With extreme precision, he opened the letter, as if he was slowly parting the lips of the softest girl on this Terra Firma.</p> <p>He extracted the letter from the envelope, noticing all the tea patterns on it, carefully made to contrast the ones he had made.</p> <p>He licked the paper, sniffing all of its intricacies.</p> <p>&quot;Hmm, Jasmine tea. He always had a peculiar palette. I do enjoy the fact that he used tea leaves from nineteen.. eigh-no, seventy-three. Impressive,&quot; James thought to himself.</p> <p>Now that he had conducted the taste test, he could now read its contents.</p> <p>&quot;Of course, I had been planning the death of this bitch for years. I'm so glad she's finally committed social suicide.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>Europa</p> <p>P.S. I don't care what kind of kinship you feel with birds you fucking degenerate no one cares if there's a D in pigeons or not.&quot;</p> <p>Satisfied, James picked out his best tailored suit, combined it with his favourite British shoes and chose his most exciting silk trousers.</p> <p>He drank some more tea while waiting, but threw it out instantly. He regretted using regular teabags, regardless of how little time he had to drink.</p> <p>He left the house, a grimace that could only be seen as an intent to kill everyone that happened to be on the same street as him on his face.</p> <p>He took a taxi to Trafalgar Square, as it had started to rain, despite the completely perfect and unbiased news source, the BBC, telling him that they would be reaching scorching temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius.</p> <p>Finally, he arrived, and he saw that Trafalgar Square was having <em>another</em> anime and manga convention.</p> <p>He respected the Asians for their discovery of the juice of the heavens, but-</p> <p>&quot;-every day we stray further from God,&quot; a voice beside him said, finishing his thought perfectly.</p> <p>James turned and saw a slender man wearing an unstructured blazer. James ran his fingers across the man's chest slowly, feeling every bump and curve.</p> <p>&quot;100% cotton? Very comfortable and lightweight, but I'm not sure if I like the feel of it when it touches my skin,&quot; James said slowly.</p> <p>The man opened his blazer and replied. &quot;Nor do I, which is why I have wool on the inside. Feels like heaven and it's much warmer,&quot; he said smugly.</p> <p>The corners of James' lips curved upwards, creating a hideous expression. &quot;You always win at this, don't you... Europa?&quot; he said slowly.</p> <p>&quot;I'm very good at thinking ahead. So, what have you planned for today, or will I have to take the lead again?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You already know where I'm taking you,&quot; James replied.</p> <p>Europa gestured outwards, as if to say 'Lead the way,' and James complied.</p> <p>He took Europa on a little trip, passing art galleries, famous theatres and even 5-star restaurants.</p> <p>Europa took in all of the buildings with fascination. He loved trying to date each one and name each style.</p> <p>After about 15 minutes of this, James finally dragged Europa into a shop.</p> <p>Europa didn't even need to look around to tell where he was. He could tell by the woody, leafy smell then engulfed him. He was in the freshest of pine forests, in the deepest depths of the ocean. He was in a tea shop.</p> <p>Europa opened his eyes after an eternity of smell and took in the room around him. He could see tea being made behind the counter, and his heart melted in anticipation of what he was going to drink.</p> <p>&quot;Any preferences?&quot; James asked.</p> <p>&quot;Surprise me,&quot; Europa answered.</p> <p>Europa sat on a maple bench, crafted masterfully by a carpenter. While it was perfect, it also had personality and love. That was what he strives for in his venture for tea.</p> <p>After a moment, James sat down opposite him, and they sat in silence as light penetrated the curtains, creating the wonderful effect of fairies dancing around the beams of light that forced their way into the room.</p> <p>Europa was lost in his daydreaming when a tray appeared in front of him, and a waiter provided them with their beverages.</p> <p>Europa looked at the tea in front of him, then up to James.</p> <p>&quot;Really? We're celebrating Theresa Gay's resignation and you want me to drink a weak tea like this? I could put honey in water and it would taste better than this!&quot;</p> <p>James, despite shivering when he heard the word honey - a result of years of torment by lesser folk - answered calmly, like a poker player.</p> <p>&quot;You really doubt my intuition that much?&quot;</p> <p>Europa nodded and took a fairly large sip.</p> <p>His mind expanded.</p> <p>Chamomile was a passive tea. It's a tea that brings back memories of sickness as your mother watches over you in bed.</p> <p>This quietness juxtaposed with the heat of a newly boiled tea, perfectly crafted using the freshest, yet most vintage-feeling leaves. It was impossible, but it was irresistible.</p> <p>He took another gulp, feeling it engulf his tongue. He wouldn't let a drop go to waste. After it swirled blissfully around his mouth, he swallowed it all, burning his throat. But it didn't matter. Whatever James had given him, he needed more.</p> <p>He looked at James, weakness in his eyes, and James knew he had control.</p> <p>&quot;Hmm.. You want something? You'll have to ask or I won't know what you want.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Please.. give me more,&quot; Europa pleaded.</p> <p>Satisfied, James stood, and Europa sat up, ready for a second helping of the juice James had blessed him with.</p> <p>However, James simply left the shop, leaving Europa all alone.</p> <p>Defeated, Europa went up to the counter and ordered something else, impressed by this place's tea.</p> <p>When he returned to the table, he noticed something.</p> <p>James had left his near-full cup on the table.</p> <p>Europa could not leave such perfect tea to go to waste, so he brought it over to his side. He brought it to his lips and drank.</p> <p>Once again, he was engulfed in pleasure. However, this time there was another taste, that he wasn't sure he could identify. He pulled his lips away and saw something shiny on the rim on the cup.</p> <p>He realised that the second taste, perfectly complementing the taste of the tea, was very tiny droplets of James' saliva.</p> <p>He was astounded by the effect such an unconventional product could create. Once the tea he had ordered arrived, he brought his lips down to the cup. The cream that covered the tea frothed onto his lip, covering his face in a white, sticky substance. He licked it off slowly, savouring the flavour. He drunk the tea, its taste augmented perfectly by the few particles of James' saliva.</p> <p>He fell into bliss and knew he would never attain this euphoria again.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
