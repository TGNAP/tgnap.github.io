href="#lordpixela-s-cipen-cipicao-x-a-pen-in-space" class="header-anchor">#</a> LordPixela's Cipen (Cipicao x A_Pen_In_Space)</h1> <h2 id="part-1"><a href="#part-1" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 1</h2> <p>It was the beginning of a new school year at TGN High school and there was the adrenaline-filled rush of first years finding old friends, finding new friends, and especially, finding a club to join. One of these clubs was the sailing club, commonly known as Red Dock. It was founded by A_Pen_In_Space, a senior at this school, and later taken over by jamesthepigeon. This club had a large reputation  of being friendly not only internally, but with members of other clubs as well.</p> <p>Now, back to our story. One of these first years was an eager little boy called Cipicao. He had learnt a lot about TGN high and was really keen to  join the sailing club and to meet Pen. Right after he got home on his first day, he instantly ticked 'Sailing Club' on his club application sheet and dropped onto his bed, wondering what his idol Pen was doing at that moment, imagining things like watching his favourite animes K-on! and Love Live. What Pen was actually doing was going on r/animemes and calling everyone there degenerates for liking a medium of art he has mixed feelings for.</p> <p>A few days later, it was finally time for cipicao to join Red Dock. He went to school early to wait for Pen, hoping to introduce himself before the induction. A few minutes later, Pen walked through the gate, furiously destroying weebs with facts and logic on his phone. Right as he finished his final sentence he noticed someone calling something that sounded like his name.</p> <p>&quot;Penpaii~!&quot; he heard. Pen looked around, wondering who had the audacity to call him such a filthy name. He finally looked down and saw Cipicao waving up to him. &quot;I'm Cipicao and I'll be joining Red Dock today! I just wanted to meet you before we started!&quot;</p> <h2 id="part-2"><a href="#part-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 2</h2> <p>Pen staggered back several steps and muttered, &quot;Ben? Ben Shapiro?&quot; He could not believe his eyes as he saw the spitting image of Ben Shapiro before him. However, upon closer inspection he could tell that it was not his Patron Saint and in fact a midget. And that midget was now extending his hand towards Pen.</p> <p>Pen was not used to physical contact so it took him a moment to realise that Cipicao wanted to shake his hand. &quot;What was that name you said? Cipocoo? What did you want?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I'm Cipicao and I'll be joining Red Dock! I wanted to meet you before we started because I heard you founded that amazing club, &quot; he said within one breath, with no sign of running out of oxygen.</p> <p>Pen stared in disbelief for two reasons. One: his name had fame outside of TGN High! The second: he could never forget the cursed word this midget cipipoo just called him. &quot;Penpaii~&quot; How he managed to say &quot;~&quot; verbally he could not comprehend.</p> <p>After many moments filled with Pen staring wide-eyed and Cipicao looking up gleefully at Pen, Pen finally he realised he had two options. Continue the conversation, or run away. He chose the latter.</p> <p>Pen sprinted for his life, running more than he had run in his life, which probably was not more than 4 metres. He was so full of fear, thinking about how his name could possibly have been amalgamated with such an evil word, that he had no idea where he was going, opening doors and ducking under tables, never daring to look backwards in case the midget could possibly be following him.</p> <p>After an exhilarating two minutes of chase, he took some steps downstairs and locked the door behind him. As he reached the bottom step and looked at his surroundings, he made a sound only comparable to the sound a squeaky door combined with a baby's cry on a packed bus makes. He saw endless walls of paintings filled with only one thing. A red-haired snake girl.</p> <p>He was in Smegliff's basement.</p> <h2 id="part-3"><a href="#part-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 3</h2> <p>Pen swiftly turned his head. He could not be here, in the basement of the biggest weeb he knew. It was common knowledge that Smegliff created a door that locked itself from the outside and would meditate in front of his anthropomorphic snake waifu for days on end, only emerging when he smelt drama coming from Opportunity, the anime and manga club of TGN high school.</p> <p>In desperation, he ran to the door, and almost screamed for the first year that had chased him. There was nothing he could do. Either he could forgot his pride and call for Cipicao or starve to death in Smegliff's basement. He would never go down the accursed path that was option three, talk to the ultimate weeb Smeg.</p> <p>He sank to the floor, sobbing about how someone like him could be dying in the most degenerate place on earth. He almost smiled at the irony. As he closed his eyes, almost ready to accept his fate, his brain teased him one last time. &quot;Penpai, Penpai!&quot; he could hear from just outside his peripheral vision.</p> <p>Instantly, Pen shot up, he could not die with the knowledge that his name had been uttered in such a filthy way. He began pacing back and forth through the room, vehemently diverting his eyes from the many pictures of a half-naked snake girl in a multitude of suggestive poses.</p> <p>After hours of Pen pondering how he could make his great escape, &quot;Penpai&quot; ringing in his head constantly, he finally realised. He was breathing, which meant there had to be some way for air to get in. He searched the basement rapidly, his pace quickening with every step. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he saw a window. Then, he saw what was in the window and his face fell.</p> <p>&quot;Penpai! Didn't you hear me calling you through here? Come up here so I can let you out!&quot; Through the window was Cipicao, who quite clearly looked as if he had spent the whole time Pen was in the basement next to the window, waiting for his senior to notice him.</p> <h2 id="part-4"><a href="#part-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 4</h2> <p>Pen just stood and stared. This child really sat outside Smeg's window calling Pen's name repeatedly for at least three hours.</p> <p>After a few moments, he realised that since this was the only exit, he would have to receive Cipicao's help or stay in Smeg's basement for the rest of his life, which was not an option for an advanced intellectual like him.</p> <p>He tried climbing up, but to no avail. 'Typical,' he thought. He knew Smeg wouldn't allow himself any chance to escape on his own. He looked up at Cipicao, who smiled knowingly before bringing out an electric saw, scaring the life out of Pen.</p> <p>Cipicao sliced through the bar windows and brought down a rope for Pen to climb up. Pen obliged, and attempted to climb with his skinny, weak arms, spurred on by his denial to be left alone in Smeg's basement.</p> <p>It took all of his energy, but after a gruelling five minutes, filled with Cipicao's encouragement and quite a lot of Pen grunting, he finally reached the top, and was pulled out with ease by Cipicao. He turned and saw that the bars were already perfectly replaced, with Cipicao casually placing a bottle of flex seal back into a duffel bag he definitely did not have in the morning.</p> <p>Pen decided to give Cipicao a chance to talk, seeing as he was saved from eternal doom by him. &quot;So Cipicao.. you said you were joining Red Dock right? It looks like you'll fit in.&quot;</p> <p>And then it dawned on them, the club induction was today, and after all the time they spent at Smeg's basement, there were only 5 minutes left to get to the club room, on the opposite side of the school, and it was the end of the school day.</p> <h2 id="part-5"><a href="#part-5" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 5</h2> <p>The end of the school day was the most dangerous time of day, and going through the main halls was practically suicide, and that was the situation Cipicao and Pen found themselves in.</p> <p>They had to run through the main halls, and the foyer, which people liked to call the Nether Hub in respect of the many people who had the misfortune to meet the diamonds. The diamonds were a group of people who excelled in their studies, and used their immunity to bully other students, whom they liked to call the irons, in order to get their money or to release stress.</p> <p>Recently, many diamonds have been permanently expelled, following a shift in management, as well as the diamonds getting careless in what they did in front of the teachers. Regardless, the Nether Hub was still a dangerous place to be, especially at the end of the school day.</p> <p>Cipicao and Pen managed to sneak through the main halls relatively safely, definitely owing to the expulsion of avid diamonds, which discouraged at lot of new students from bullying. However, as they reached the foyer, they saw the challenge they would have to overcome. O8f was in the Nether Hub, taking a break from raiding new clubs so he could relax and get some easy money off irons and passive diamonds. They also knew that Alfredobilly would be near. Unlike o8f, Billy went in the Nether Hub to release stress and generally had the courtesy to not take the person's money.</p> <p>Cipicao peeked first, watching o8f casually walk up to an unsuspecting first year and pickpocket him lazily, only to punch him in the face once the boy noticed something was up. He had no idea how they would make it to the clubroom. Pen looked, shaking and crying. In all his years at TGN high, he never let himself be caught out in the Nether Hub, and he knew this streak was about to come to an end.</p> <h2 id="part-6"><a href="#part-6" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 6</h2> <p>Pen looked into the foyer, tears in his eyes. He had no ideas about how to get past, and each second wasted brought them ever closer to the deadline of being at the Red Dock Clubroom in 3 minutes.</p> <p>Suddenly, Cipicao, spurred on not only by his admiration for Pen, but also by his determination to join Red Dock, dashed across the room, knocking over first years much larger than him, clutching Pen's hand tightly.</p> <p>Pen had no time to react, and it took all his concentration to stay upright. 'Cipicao could run extremely fast' , he thought. 'How come he couldn't catch me earlier?'</p> <p>By the time Pen finished that thought, they were already going up the steps and they could finally see the classroom. Pen sighed, recalling all the events that happened on that day.</p> <p>They opened the door to find the Red Dock members, as well as a few first years talking to each other. They all stared at the pair that just entered.</p> <p>&quot;This is Cipicao,&quot; Pen said bashfully. &quot;He's a first year and he pretty much saved my life.&quot;</p> <p>They got settled in, Cipicao talking to the other senior Red Dock members along with a few new members. Pen sat alone, ready to end this day, when suddenly, he heard something that sent a chill down his spine.</p> <p>&quot;So.. I heard you were in my basement, hee hee,&quot; softly whispered a voice into his ear.</p> <h2 id="part-7"><a href="#part-7" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 7</h2> <p>Pen almost cried out. He thought he was finally safe, but then it turned out that someone knew he was in Smegliff's basement, and the news somehow reached Smeg himself! He turned slowly, noticing every terrifying detail on Smeg's body, most notably the massive pillow he stapled to his boxers, mimicking the feeling his snake girl waifu would give him if she existed.</p> <p>&quot;Wh-who told you that?&quot; Pen asked tentatively, wishing wholeheartedly that Cipicao could save him one last time.</p> <p>&quot;A little birdie,&quot; Smeg replied, with an unbreaking smile. &quot;So, did you.. like my humble abode?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Uh.. I mean if I was a weeb I guess I would have liked it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;So you mean to say, that you intruded into MY basement, looked at MY pictures, and then have the audacity to say it wasn't satisfactory?&quot; said Smeg, full of fury, greatly contrasting his previous manner.</p> <p>Pen scanned the room, looking for a way to escape, yet found none. Everyone broke eye contact, knowing that once Smeg was truly upset, there was no way of going back.</p> <p>Cipicao was just returning from the bathroom when he saw this unfold. He crept up behind Smeg, slowly, slowly, until he was so close he could smell the unwashed pillow now dangling from his crotch.</p> <p>In an instant, he pulled the pillow away from Smeg, causing the most unearthly howl to emanate from Smeg's mouth. With the instincts and grace of an antelope, he dodged all of Smeg's flails and grabbed Pen, dragging him behind James.</p> <p>James finally looked up, realising that this would be a mess he would have to deal with. He stepped up and lazily said, &quot;If you don't stop, we'll ban monster girls from our channels.&quot;</p> <p>Smeg recoiled into a corner, knowing that the risks outweighed the benefits and so decided to leave the clubroom until he could think rationally again.</p> <h2 id="part-8"><a href="#part-8" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 8</h2> <p>Pen turned to Cipicao and said, &quot;Thanks for saving me Cipicao.. again.&quot;</p> <p>Cipicao just smiled and reassuringly said, &quot;No problem Penpai.&quot;</p> <p>Then, someone from the crowd howled with laughter. &quot;Penpai? Pfft that's great. GUYS LET'S ALL CALL HIM PENPAI!&quot;</p> <p>Pen stared at the crowd, trying to identify the voice. He knew that if word got around that he could be called such a terrible name, his social life would be over. Well at least Cipicao would still be there for him.. no! He could not think like that.</p> <p>He just shouted, &quot;You will NOT call me Penpai. If any of you call me Penpai, I'll usurp James.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You didn't mind when the midget called you Penpai! Ooohh do you.. like him?&quot; the heckler called.</p> <p>&quot;Shut up! There's no way I'd like a midget like him. B-baka!&quot;</p> <p>Pen finally saw who the heckler was. It was LordPixela. He was a member of Opportunity, the anime and manga club, but he liked to visit Red Dock as the rooms were right next to each other. He was extremely popular, and he got many modelling jobs due to his sheer beauty.</p> <p>Pixela cried with laughter, &quot; 'baka'? Oh my god this is great! Penpai is a standard Tsundere! Hey Penpai, come join us as Opportunity, seeing as you're a real life tsundere!&quot;</p> <p>Pen was filled with rage, both at himself for somehow saying 'baka' and at the world, for letting this misfortune happen to him. He just stood there, getting more embarrassed by the second, until he felt a tug, and he was back in the corridors running.</p> <p>Cipicao was pulling Pen away from the bad people, and Pen felt at ease again. He let himself be taken away by Cipicao's tight, warm grip, until they came to a stop in a tight room. He looked around and saw that they were in a bathroom stall.</p> <p>&quot;There, they shouldn't find us here for a while. I'm glad that Red Dock is really warm and open, but I could tell you weren't comfortable and I didn't want you to get angry, Penpai.&quot;</p> <h2 id="part-9"><a href="#part-9" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 9</h2> <p>Pen slumped back onto the toilet seat, almost sobbing. All of Red Dock had heard the name Penpai, and, even worse, the Anime and Manga club knew it! He had no idea what to do with himself.</p> <p>Cipicao had his ear against the door, occasionally turning back to check on Pen. He had no idea what to do to help his senior, who was clearly going through a rough time. He kept repeating his motion of checking the door and smiling at Pen until Pen finally spoke.</p> <p>&quot;So.. uh. Thanks for saving me those times Cipicao, but it seems like it was all for nothing, since my social life has completely disintegrated in the last 5 minutes. I understand if you want to leave me for a better member of Re-&quot; his sentence was cut off by Cipicao putting his finger to Pen's lips, shushing him softly.</p> <p>&quot;You think that after all that, I'd just leave you because people called you Penpai? I love it, and I don't think there's any member of Red Dock that's better.&quot; Cipicao said while climbing up Pen's legs. They were now face to face, Cipicao balancing his knees on top of Pen's lap, looking directly into each other's eyes.</p> <p>&quot;Thanks but I really don't have a future here anymore, even if you think otherwise.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Well then, I can be your future,&quot; Cipicao said, closing his eyes, leaning forwards, lips slowly parting.</p> <p>Pen relaxed, leaning slightly forward to close the gap, and their lips met. Cipicao's heart was racing, and Pen could feel every beat, enveloping him in its warmth. He leaned back, Cipicao now clutching Pen's chest to keep himself balanced. They stayed like this for eternity, Cipicao eventually lowering his heart beat to match Pen's, until their silence was broken by the bell.</p> <p>Pen returned to his senses, overwhelmed by what he just did, but also exhilarated. They ran out of the bathrooms and went back to their homes, recalling the events of that school day. As they were doing this, Pen swore he could hear a soft &quot;Fuhuhu~&quot; from the bathroom stall they were leaving.</p> <p>Fast forward a few days, and it was common knowledge in Red Dock and Opportunity that Pen had finally managed to tolerate another person, though no one knew the extent to which their relationship went. Or at least, that's what Pen hoped with all his heart.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
