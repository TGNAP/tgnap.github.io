This dump contains most public channels of TGN. It contains two heavily-compressed archives: .7z and .zip. (390MB -> 27MB (zip) or 18 MB (7z))
All files are in HTML, so we recommend opening with a good internet connection (autoloading images) and loads of RAM.
If you know HTML syntax, you can also try opening the file with a code editor. (I personally recommend using Visual Studio Code.)
