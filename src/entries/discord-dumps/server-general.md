This entry contains two heavily-compressed archives: .7z and .zip. After unpacking, the archive weights around 315 MB. (there's no difference between the archives)

Inside, you'll find three chat dump files:
.html - user-friendly, NOT RECOMMENDED unless you have good internet connection and LOADS of RAM
.txt - light-weight-ish user-friendly file
.csv - machine-friendly dump. Good for processing.
