# Demise escapes the IRS (by titaniumcow)

SonofDemise's diary

Dear diary. Today started like any other day, until i get a knock on the door.

So i go out into the living room, minding the wet roaches as i walk.

I finally pull open to the door, and..

It's the IRS, again!

This is the fourth time this week they've come here!

So anyways, i reach for my gun to ward the evil mr IRS off. Yknow?

And they start babbling about child support and taxes??

Like WTF. Who is child?? And why do i have to support him?

So anyways, i chase the IRS man off into his car after threathening him yknow.

So the next day, the fucker pulls up with a police officer...

So i obviously pull my gun on him. And to my surprise, the police officer tases me!

Like WTF. What did i do to you dude.

So anyways.. There I am. Laying on the floor. And the fucker starts to look through my house.

And im obviously angered by that!
So i crawl over to my furnace and grab my rifle!

Then i go into the kitchen and kill the IRS man.

Skip to the next day...

I woke up today with a knock to my door before it being busted down! That's destruction of property...

I did not like it at all!

So they all come in black suites yknow!

And they keep yelling stuff like FBI and Clear!

I don't get it... What's so clear about my house?? It's a mess!

So they come into my room with riot shields and automatic rifles.

And im sitting there like "Whaaatt??"

Then they try to take my rifle away, so i shoot one of them in the leg!! He fell down! V funny!

They they aim their guns on me and i kinda put my hands in the air??

I give them a smirk as i take a remote control from my back pocket.

I press the button and the black men are all torn to shreds by my epic light machine guns comntrolled by bluetooth! V epic!

They all fall to the ground like flies!!

I stand victorious over their bodies.
I have once again tricked the vermin IRS!

Demise leaves his apartament and gets into his getaway vehicle.

He speeds off into the sunset.
