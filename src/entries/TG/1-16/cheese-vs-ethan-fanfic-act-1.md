# Cheese vs Ethan fanfic: Act 1 (by u/bitansea (LimeishPingu))

As Cheese_Addict walked the dusty streets of Modville, he took a quick second to grab a bite. He munched into a cooked potato that Limeish gave to him as a birthday present, as a few bugs flew by. The glistening yet foreboding City of Superiority loomed in the distance and the flickering street lamps of the once-bustling town of Modville that has long since been devoid of any intelligent life. Suddenly, he noticed something was off.

Footprints on the nearly-invisible path. The singed grass of a recently-ignited firework. A singular strand of light-blue polyester. This meant only one thing to Cheese Addict, and as the realization hit him, he heard a sinister laugh, almost like a hyena’s. The laugh came from a shadowy figure in the pitch black of an alleyway. Cheese turned around, only to find a sword at his throat, with the face of iiEthan breathing down on him.

“Cheese, you wimp, you swine,” said Ethan with his narcissistic, sadistic eyes, “You DARE set foot in this town, MY TOWN, even after you became a council member of Spirit City?”

Cheese stayed silent, and Ethan continued with his unhinged rant.

“You piece of shit, you coward, you are so bunched-up in your little small world with your friends, your RANDO friends, and now you are one of those people, the ones that suck up to the stinkin’ disgusting rando’s, those people…”

Cheese was now shaking in rage now, and was holding back all of his power in order to not cause damage to the towns on the Western Megalopolis.

“Oh, you scared, you freak?” Ethan said, with a smirk on his face. The smirk of a man who held true contempt for the human known as Cheese.

Cheese could not hold it in anymore.

With his Sharpness 5 Strength 50 fist, he punched the netherite sword that Ethan was holding into a fine, black, dust. His eyes glowing with rage, hot tears streaming down his face, he says with the voice of a man with all of the determination and emotion in the world. “You NEVER talk about my friends like that!!” Cheese said, right before he dealt the first blow with his bare hands.

Ethan could not have guessed what would have happened. As he was pummeled by cheese’s pure obsidian knuckles, he could feel every single bone in his torso, from his pelvis to his many ribs, being turned into small granules of calcium. Not even a napple and resistance 5 could save him from the excruciating pain of Cheese’s emotionally charged onslaught.

“AND THIS IS THE FINAL BLOW!” Cheese said, as he raised his fist a final time. This fist, accelerating to 1500x the speed of sound, barrelled towards Ethan’s bruised, bloody head. Ethan braced for the impact, as the punch made impact on his already shattered skull.

The impact was brutal. Everything built on the Western Overworld Highway, Superiority, Modville, Nowhere, Novac, Ern, Grogstown, and Seatown were all destroyed in the resulting shock wave. Spawn was covered in the rubble, the cave event being filled up, and locked away once again. Spirit City heard the blast all the way from its distant location on the Western hemisphere, and in the sky of the server was a glowing, floating figure. Long haired, with a moderating suit, eyes glowing even brighter than his already bright, muscular body. Cheese_Addict became more of a new sun, as he was unbounded by his chains of kindness and forgiveness.

Unbounded.

Finally free.

Ethan smiled and laughed a nefarious laugh as he clicked the respawn button, as he knew he succeeded in his goal.
