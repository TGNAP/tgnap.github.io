There is a plague on the server, slowly corrupting it from the inside.

There comes a time when you know what must be done, for it has tormented your mind for as long as you can remember.

There is a race of impurity that inhabits this server. A group of people so vile that i get sick to my stomach every time i see one.

This race of devils are none other than the bedrock players.

They are soulless individuals capable of glitching through walls and locked objects.

Their implementation is responsible for many problems on this server like, the death of the iron farms, the glitching of the end portal, the mob cap issue and many more.

I propose an idea some might see as controversial, or even inhumane.

But i tell you, these race of devils are far from human.

They are the vermin of this server, the rat you find crawling in your wall.

And what do you do when you find a rat in your wall? You gather your strength and exterminate it.

And that's what we need to do.

You all know this has been a long time coming, and i know many of you don't have the guts to

speak out against this menace, but i believe in the good will of the players of this server.

I propose a plan to quarantine these devils.

We will make proposed districts in our towns where these extremities can live.

Special areas where they can reside, away from the superior java playerbase.

They will wear stars above their names to symbolise their impurity.

We will send those of them who disobey off to re education camps, to strengthen their

will and make them willing to listen to us.

We will need people to mine obsidian for us, and thats where the loyal obsidian players come in.

We will create a class system akin to the Ancien regime of 18th century France.

The mods as the First estate, then the donos as the second estate, then the non donos as the burguoise at the bottom.

My dream is not for the bedrock players though.

I am not saying we should kill the bedrock population,

I am just saying we should distance away from this race of impure heathens.

They will not take part in our society of freedom, they will be allowed to live out their lives in their designated districts.

How will we achieve this you ask? I will make a place of communication where we can elaborate on our further plans.

You will be put through a test to prove your worth to the community.
