# Nino x HeyItsSirius fanfic (by titaniumcow)

Nino nudged the door slightly, letting himself into the abandoned apartment.

The air smelt like urine and concrete

Nino sat down in the middle of the room, brushing away shards of glass and dirty needles as to not poke himself.

He waited patiently for &ohim to arrive. 

He reached into his pocket for a lighter and lit a fire in a nearby trash can. 

He was taken slightly aback when he heard three short knocks on the door.

The man he had been waiting for in what had felt like an eternity had finally arrived.

Sirius entered the broken down apartment, carrying a black duffle bag over his shoulder.

He sat down next to Nino and grabbed the zip of the bag.

He zipped it open slowly, giving Nino a slight smirk as he did so.

"Just open the fucking bag already Sirius!" Nino complained.

Sirius chuckled and zipped the bag completely open, revealing 1 Kilogram of Colombian crack cocaine. 

Nino looked at the goods in awe as Sirius handed Nino a clean needle.

Nino handed Sirius a bad of 250 Euros and a burger king coupon.

Sirius took the money and stuffed it into his pockets.

Sirius emptied the substances carefully into the syringe.

He handed it to Nino and said "Bon Appetit!"

Nino injected the syringe into his forearm with much glee.

Sirius' eyes began creeping into the back of his head, and was foaming at the mouth as he took his share of the crack.

Nino saw spiders crawl all over his skin. He tried to scratch the spiders off, but to no awail.
He picked up a glass shard and cut into his arm. Thick droplets of blood coated the floor, attracting cockroaches and rats.

Nino saw another man enter the building holding a knife. He stood up and punched at the man, his fists going right through him as if he were a ghost.

Nino slipped in the pile of his own blood, his head slamming into the concrete. Nino started getting quite dizzy now.

He could see Sirius shaking on the ground. Nino took the same glass shard he had hurt himself with and shanked Sirius in the stomach. Sirius started convulsing as he bled out. 

Nino ran around the room, trying to shake off the creatured crawling all over him. He crept down on the ground and slammed his head into the concrete, filling his forehead with shards of glass and dirty needles. 

He started tearing away at his already fragile skinm he thought *If there's no skin to crawl on, you can't crawl on me hehe.* He scratched at his arms with the glass shard. He tore off the loose skin, revealing muscles and flesh. His vision started to go blurry until he collapsed onto the ground.

Nino woke up, the high had worn off. He had a vicious headache. The air smelt like iron and alcahol. Nino tried to stand up, but his legs would not listen to him. He crawled out from the apartment, his arms getting scratched up even more by the harsh concrete floor. 

He fell down the fire escape ladder, breaking his hip. He gave out a bloodcurling scream, alerting people around him to his location. He blacked out and woke up in an ambulance. 

He l8r died in da UMC Dutch hospital. spread da msg to end drug.
