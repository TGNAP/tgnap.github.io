## SONG OF SLEEP

warm white pillows
lay me down to sleep
hum pretty songs
about far away woods
the cool touch of stone
blue water eyes
and the prettiest people
brun hair so soft
and every sweet smell
and the deepest sunset
with rays that tickle the skin
as we sleep peacefully
moon now

## MISSING YOU

All the people I miss
come to me in songs
and movies I can't watch anymore

They tell me they're still heremore or less
that only parts of them are dead

What should I do
with all these people
the undeleted phone numbers

Which fill my contacts
and make me feel guilty
for things I did and didn't do

What should I do
what would I say
to all the people I miss

## A VISION OF SUMMER

vanilla
grass, freshly-cut
dirt, packed with a shovel
bare feet, wiped on a mat
and a stained white dress
