## Part 1

It was late on a Saturday night, and the TGN server was practically empty. Theogili, alone, pondered his thoughts, with no noobs to spawnkill. Suddenly, MarioFoli joined the server. "join vc" Mario said in the chat. Theo obeyed him and joined the voice chat. "What's going on, Mario?" "Well, I wanted to know if you wanted to do an irl meetup sometime, since we've become close enough friends." Theo's heart skipped a beat. MarioFoli, the venerable leader of the RefugeeGang raiding group? Too perfect. And that Spider-Man skin lowkey gave Theo a boner. "Sure, where are you?" Theo asked, trying not to pour too much enthusiasm into his voice. "I'm on the east coast" Mario said.  "You?" "So am I, in Virginia" Theo replied. "Wait, that's sweet," Mario said. "Wanna meet at my place? My address is 12345 First St." "Sure!" Theo said, unable to contain his enthusiasm anymore. "Tomorrow evening, then, about 6pm." "Sounds good to me" Mario said. "See you then!"  They disconnected from the vc, and Theo logged off from Minecraft, running into the bathroom. Just the thought of what could happen tomorrow was making him so aroused. He emerged 2 minutes later, visions of passionate blocky sex going through his mind.

## Part 2

Theogili parked his 2004 Subaru Outback at 12345 First St. The neighborhood was huge, as was every house. Theo was pretty sure he could fit two of his houses in any one of these mansions – MarioFoli’s parents must be loaded. Getting out of his car, Theo took a peek into the garage on his way to the doorstep. Parked inside was a jet black Lamborghini and a McLaren. Do these people even drive normal cars? It made sense, though – fit right into the neighborhood aesthetic.
Theo took a deep breath and rang the door. Mario told him he had the house to himself for the next few days since his parents were on vacation, but maybe he had a butler or something. Theo, who has spent so much of his time gaming, has hardly any social skills and hopes that there is no one else to talk to.
He was lucky – the door opened up to reveal who he could only assume was Mario. “Is this Theogili?” the teen asked.
“Yes, and I guess you’re MarioFoli,” Theo said.
“Yup,” Mario replied. “Come on in, this is gonna be an epic night.” Of course, Mario was using the term “epic” ironically – but Theo figured it would be both literally and figuratively epic.
Following Mario, Theo was led through an expansive living room, up a flight of stairs, and into what was presumably some sort of gaming room. There were two PC’s in the dimly lit room, distinguishable by their idly glowing RGB’s. On the wall, a 60-inch curved Samsung OLED TV was mounted, with an Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and a Nintendo Switch underneath, all with custom controllers and aesthetic.
Theo whistled. “This is all your stuff?”
“Yeah, it is,” Mario said. “My parents bought the second PC for themselves, but they only ever use their work laptops, so it’s basically mine. Wanna play some Minecraft on the TGN server?”
Theo eagerly agreed, and for the next two hours they spawnkilled newcomers in the nether highways, claiming incredible loot such as stone pickaxes and random assortments of seeds.
