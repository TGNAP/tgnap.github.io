# The Man With a Spoon (by SmegLiff)

It was an ordinary day, the Red Dock students are sitting together during lunch break. A loud crunching sound can be heard in the distance, it’s the anime club’s table.

“Do you guys want to hear me eat?” Killer queen said, as he starts to pour more milk into his cereal that was somehow smuggled in. Some students are indeed listening for some reason, but their attention is mostly focused on their phones. After a few slurps and a lot of crunches Killer lets out a sound of pain. “What happened?” asked the group, starting to become interested.

“I slapped my balls with the spoon.”

At this point, the students from other tables have gathered around the anime club. All is silent, with mixed emotions of disgust, confusion, shock, and a lot of stares.

“You did what?” Everyone shouted over each other, looking for answers to such a ridiculous situation Killer Queen has found himself in.

“I flailed the spoon around when no one paid attention and I accidentally hit myself in the balls.” The shouts have gone silent, no one knows what to do with this answer. The students walked back to their seats and continued to eat their lunch. Killer Queen silently shoved the spoon down his throat.
