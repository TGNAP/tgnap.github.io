## SCP-027

**Item:** SCP-027
**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-027 is to be kept in a 10m x 3m x 10m humanoid containment cell, under constant surveillance in order to report any SCP-027-1 events. A bird cage is to be regularly maintained within the cell for housing SCP-027 during an SCP-027-1 event.

**Description:** SCP-027 is a Caucasian Male Humanoid in the later teenage years of development. SCP-027 is believed to be British in origin, however this is unverifiable due to the original discovery and containment of SCP-027.
SCP-027 was originally recovered on █-█-20██, in Calais, France, after a report of a “boy falling out of the sky”. When foundation personnel retrieved SCP-027 from a nearby hospital, after an allocated period of mental recuperation, personnel requested an interview. (see addendum 1.)
SCP-027 has the ability to turn into an instance of Columba livia (common pigeon) randomly and often against his will. He will remain sapience and will often show great distress upon these events, classified SCP-027-1. SCP-027 is usually compliant with staff and will be allowed to access the internet while not under the effect of an SCP-027-1 event.

**ADDENDUM 1: AUDIO LOG FROM SCP-027 INTERVIEW**
**INTERVIEWER:** Researcher Wuzado
**INTERVIEWEE:** SCP-027

**BEGIN LOG**
**Researcher Wuzado:** so, SCP-027-
**SCP-027:** Please just call me James.
**Researcher Wuzado:** So, James, what led up to you plummeting out of the sky?
**SCP-027:** Well, I can’t exactly say wha-
**Researcher Wuzado:** Don’t worry, you won’t be reprimanded for anything you admit to here.
**SCP-027:** Alright. I was at the bar with some friends, when I decided to down an entire bottle of beer.
**Researcher Wuzado:** And how did this correlate to you getting hundreds of feet in the air?
**SCP-027:** Well, after I drank the entire bottle, I realised I was a bird.
**Researcher Wuzado:** And what did you do after you realised this?
**SCP-027:** I’d just realised I was a fucking bird. What else was I meant to do but panic?
**Researcher Wuzado:** So you flew to France, and then turned back into a human again?
**SCP-027:** I landed in France? Just my fucking luck.

## SCP-069

**Item:** SCP-069
**Object Class:** Keter Neutralised

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-69 (also known as OGBUBBY) is to be kept in site-12 (colloquially known as “Ban hell” due to O5-1’s use of her “banhammer” to send anomalies to the site and their subsequent classification as Neutralised) until further notice. SCP-069 is to be kept in a 10m x 3m x 10m humanoid containment cell with constant airflow. Staff are required to wear a hot dog costume while interacting with SCP-069, and are forbidden to mention SCP-054, lest his secondary anomalous natures manifest. If SCP-069’s secondary natures do manifest, he is to be restationed to Site 12 immediately.

**Description:** SCP-069 is a Male Caucasian Humanoid standing at a height of 5’8”. While in appearance, SCP-069 may seem identical to the average male of his age, his primary anomalous properties manifest whenever any stimuli aggravates him. SCP-069 has an extremely high cap to his level of anger, more than ten times the average citizen of his native Opportunity. This affect acts almost memetic to those around him with similarly high caps, causing them to also be aggravated to their personal cap. The wearing of a hotdog suit seems to reduce the effect significantly and lower SCP-069’s memetic resistance.

SCP-069 has a secondary anomalous effect in which manifests whenever another Humanoid mentions SCP-054. The person who mentioned SCP-054 will referred to as SCP-069-1 until they expire. 100% of the time, SCP-069 will respond by claiming his name is `[REDACTED]` (name similar to SCP-054’s street name phonetically, memetic) and ask any authority figure to “ban” all instances of SCP-069-1. SCP-069-1 instances will immediately feel feelings of regret and nausea upon any form of reprimanding from the authority figure, and will normally continue to have this breakdown thinking they caused genuine harm to SCP-069. The only way to cease these effects is for no punishment to be attempted or termination of SCP-069-1.

**Incident 069-A:** On the 6-6-19, SCP-069’s secondary anomalous properties manifested in a crowded area. He was subsequently removed from public interaction and placed in site 12. Currently a [DATA EXPUNGED] # of people have been designated as an SCP-069-1 instance.
