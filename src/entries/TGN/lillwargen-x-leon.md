# LordPixela's Lillwargen x Leon

## Part 1

This is another story set in TGN high, this time concerning the red dock member Lillwargen and the member to literally every town Leon.

Extremely loud shouting could be heard from the Red Dock Clubroom. This could be heard every Friday afternoon, dedicated to discussing politics, a hot topic everywhere, but even more so in this room.

"PURE CAPITALISM IS ANARCHISM"

"HOW CAN YOU BE SO WRONG, AND IN ANY CASE, WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS WHY I'M A TROTSKYIST"

"WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS ALL POLITICS, NOT WHY YOU WANT TO SUCK STALIN'S TOES"

"Hey man I keep telling you it's a no homo crush ok."

That's how most Fridays went, with the two opposites shouting at each other about the definition of a word that wasn't even relevant to the point they were discussing. This was Red Dock's spectator sport, with many bets won and lost on who would emerge victorious from this shouting match.

At the end of club time, Jamesthepigeon blew his whistle and declared this match null and void, considering all the pair did was argue about whether Hitler was a closeted bisexual. The two shook hands resentfully and packed their bags, returning to a fairly normal conversation, albeit there being a very palpable tension in the air.

"Hey Leon, it seems like you're getting better at describing your points. No more talking about whether historical figures were gay or not though," Lillwargen said with a chuckle.

"You too Lily, but you're the one who brought it up first," Leon said, smiling.

They walked home, planning their next points for the next weekly Friday argument.

## Part 2

They saw each other a few more times in the week, their excitement rising in anticipation of the next debate on Friday. Every once in a while, Lillwargen would whisper "gay" into Leon's ear, to which Leon could not react, as they would get in trouble with the student council for bringing up politics in the corridors.

Thursday evening, Leon rummaged through his notes, trying to find the one point that would find Lillwargen be as destroyed as the spirits his ideology broke. He stayed up until 2am, until he finally found what he was looking for!

Leon strutted into the Clubroom with a smug look on his face. He looked around, waiting to see what weak defense Lily would have, until he saw Lillwargen sitting at the desk with the exact same look of confidence.

Thoughts raced through Leon's mind. He was sure that not even Lillwargen would be able to form a coherent argument against the points he would bring up, but why else would he be looking so confident.

In this game of political poker, Lillwargen was winning. He kept a confident face and invited Leon to sit down at the other end of the desk. Leon complied, and eventually, the rest of Red Dock and Opportunity sat in various places around the room, knowing that if you were anywhere close to the two, you would not be able to hear properly for the next week.

"So," Leon said, organising his papers. "I'll start shall I?"

Lillwargen nodded, keeping the same confident and piercing look, unnerving Leon so much that he dropped a few papers, lowering his morale as he bent down to pick them up, feeling utterly humiliated before the battle even began.

The two locked eyes, and they started to argue.

## Part 3

Leon started with a stutter, but quickly recomposed himself. "A-all capitalists would fare better under communism, as they would not have to worry about finances and debt. Only a small percentage of capitalists manage to be financially stable and this usually only occurs past their middle ages, where they can't enjoy the benefits until later life."

Lillwargen nonchalantly agreed. "That's a great idea Leon, it is difficult for people to get money in capitalism."

"HOWEVER, all your exampl- wait what?" Leon stared. "You agree with me?"

"I do," Wargen said promptly. "It is difficult for people to get money in capitalism. However capitalism rewards people who work hard and have ambitions. It benefits the state whilst also benefitting the person."

This left Leon wildly disconcerted. Wargen's prompt agreement followed by a difficult argument had him on his metaphorical knees, at the mercy of the right-wing Swede.

He grasped for a point. "But there will be people who start and the bottom and stay there for the rest of their lives."

"That's a cultural effect, not an effect of capitalism. And also, there have been steps to equalise everyone's opportunity, and last time I checked, neither America nor the United Kingdom are communist.

This was the final blow. Leon had lost this day. He had an unstoppable sword, and it has lost to Wargen's immovable shield.

Wargen calmly said, "Better luck next time."

The crowd did the customary applause to signify the end of the debate and most went on their way, astonished by how quickly Leon was shut down.

Gerbilcity, more commonly known as Val, walked up to Leon and patted him on the shoulder. Ninobf followed behind her.

"yyyggbh. iiwssspristseulus," she said.

Nino translated her gibberish as usual. "You did good. It was a surprise to see you lose."

Leon smiled. "Thanks Val. You too Nino. You know I was sure I was going to win this one. But I guess it was meant to be."

"lllgren scyyh"

"Lillwargen's scary huh," Nino interpreted once again.

"Yeah, he's a really good debater, but I know I'll find the point that'll finally convince him. See you guys next week."

Leon went home, replaying the debate over and over in mind, analysing what Lillwargen had done to beat him so swiftly.

## Part 4

Lillwargen could hardly contain his laughter. He barely got through that by the skin of his teeth! 'That was an awesome gamble, haha!' he thought to himself giddily. Wargen had guessed that Leon would over-prepare for this week's debate and so he'd decided to keep things extremely simple to throw him off balance.

After he got home, he started to plan. He knew that Leon would not let himself get disturbed that easily, especially after how quickly he had lost this week. Leon's points were extremely valid, and Wargen knew that in another week they would be much more stable and nearly impossible to dispute.

He started to research many things indicating capitalism's successes, staying firmly away from any groups that could be interpreted as fascist, knowing that that would be a surefire way to get shot down.

As the week started, and the days grew closer to Friday, Lillwargen could genuinely smile at Leon, knowing that this week's debate would be the best in a very long time.

On Wednesday, at lunchtime, Leon brought Wargen to the library. "Here are some books I found Lily. I felt like it would be a good idea if we studied from similar sources so we can have a stable base in our debates." Wargen smiled, glad that Leon was putting as much effort into these debates and he contemplated what life would be like without hi- without them. Definitely without them. Not him. At all.

Wargen shook his head to clear his thoughts as he heard a very strange noise.

"Lily and Leon in the library. K-i-s-s-i-n-g. First comes love, then comes marriage. Then comes lilltrot in the baby carriage."

Wargen looked around, blushing that someone could think they were like that. He saw that the person singing was Killer Queen. No one knew his real name, he got his as he only sang Killer Queen at full volume, quite often late into the night.

"Shut up Queen. Go eat a spoon or something," Leon called back, earning a few annoyed shushes from library-goers.  "See you Friday then Lily. Hopefully we can get past first base," he said with a wink.

## Part 5

When Lillwargen got home, he took the books Leon gave him earlier out of his bag and put them on his desk, noticing that Leon had put little sticky markers in  between some pages.

Wargen opened the first page that was marked and saw that a few paragraphs were circled in pencil. He read what they were and laughed. Leon had circled some of the points that he could use in the debate.

Wargen just laughed to himself endlessly. Now Leon was using Wargen's own tactic against him.

He turned more pages, and saw that all of what Leon circled were points leaning towards communism and why it's better. Wargen started to read the book the whole way through, marking pages just like Leon did.

The next day, Wargen snuck the book with his own markings into Leon's bag at lunch, whilst whispering in his ear, "Let's have fun tomorrow, hee hee."

After he got back home, Lillwargen started to really prepare for the debate, as now he gave Leon an advantage. He wrote down some notes for himself so that he still had a plan and wouldn't just react to whatever Leon said, as he knew there would be inconsistencies if he did so. He studied late into the night, until he realised it was 2am and went to bed swiftly.

The next day was Friday, and Lillwargen barely remembered to get up, as he was so tired from his activities the night before.

He rushed to school, barely ready and managed to get to his first class on time. It took all his energy, but finally, it was time for him to get to the club room. He saw Leon and smiled, wondering whether he looked into the book to see Wargen's markings.

They prepared for the verbal fight, and the regular crowd gathered. They prepared, and the whistle blew.
