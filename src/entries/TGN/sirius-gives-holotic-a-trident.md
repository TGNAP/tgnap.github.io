# Sirius gives Holotic a Trident by u/LordPixela

It was early in the morning, with only around 15 people on the TGN server, when Sirius was playing on TGN, talking with his Minecraft GF (who's actually a dude btw) Pixela.

He was going trident hunting when he saw something in chat.

*Holotic has joined the game*

"Hey Holo," Sirius said, amongst the sea of Holothigga that spammed the chat. "I'm going trident hunting, want to join?"

"Nah, it's too boring. I'll buy one from you though."

They used /spawn, and Sirius sold him a riptide trident for 100 diamonds.

Holotic went to Opportunity to test it, since they had an abundance of towers. He made sure to get his elytra, so he wouldn't fall to his death.

He waited about 20 minutes for it to finally rain, and he pulled the trident back like an olympiad about to throw a javelin. He threw it and he flew into the air!

He let himself free fall for a while before spreading the wings of his elytra, feeling the wind fly by his fingertips.

He pulled back the trident again and let loose, and it read in chat.

*Holotic experienced kinetic energy.*
