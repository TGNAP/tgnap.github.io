## Chapter 1

This is a story about a young boy called OverFast. OverFast liked to play Minecraft on the internet with old men. One day OverFast applied to be a moderator on a minecraft server. He did this to impress a girl who had asked him to prom. He went into school the next day and said over lunch, “Hey Emily” (that was the name of the girl), “Guess what? I’m a moderator now”.
Emily’s jaw dropped. “A…. a moderator? Of what?”
OverFast replied confidently: “A Minecraft Server with over 100 active members of course”
“Oh…. Wow. Wow.” Emily said, her heart racing.
“I know I said I would wait until marriage but this… this is big news. Did I ever tell you how attractive you are, OverFast?”

“Wait what?” Came a voice from the table behind them. “You’re a mod on a server with over 100 active players?” This was the voice of Kaitlyn Johnson, the most popular cheerleader in school. Every boy was head over heels in love with her, she had blonde hair and always wore very short skirts.
“I sure am”, OverFast replied, his chest pushed outwards with pride. “I am able to do roll backs and look into people’s inventorys”
“Jesus Christ. Meet me in the art classroom in five minutes.”

Now while OverFast had only had limited success with the opposite sex before, he wasn’t at all surprised about all the new attention he was getting. Emily held his hand all the way to the art classroom. There was no way she was going to miss out on an opportunity like this. How many girls get to go out with a moderator, let alone date one? She couldn’t let Kaitlyn Johnson steal him away..

## Chapter 2

Emily held her breath as OverFast opened the door to the art classroom. Inside was Kaitlyn Johnson with a disgusted look on her face.
“Back off bitch, this moderator is mine!” she snarled at Emily.
“You’re such a gold digger Kaitlyn...” Emily replied. “I liked him even before he was a tier three donator. You’re sooo shallow.”
OverFast retorted wittily: “Calm down girls, I can just date both of you at the same time.”

## Chapter 3

The next couple of days were a blur. Countless girls were giving OverFast their snaps, he had to use his super quick moderator typing skills to keep up with it all. Countless picture after picture flooding his dms, OverFast was spending hours each day going through all of them.
The next week, OverFast was walking down the hall towards his locker, high-fiving every guy that passed him and winking at all the girls. He started putting his book back into his locker when he heard a shout come from behind him.
“Hey, hey OverFast! Is this allowed?” The voice belonged a young freshman called Theo. Ever since OverFast became a mod Theo had been spending a lot of time with OverFast.
“Well technically Theo you’re not allowed to run in the halls, but you won’t get expelled for it.”
“Oh okay. Hey OverFast! Hey OverFast! Can you hear me? Can I go chat to Will in this classroom?”
“Theo, that door is locked.”
“Yeah, but I know a way in – if I hit this kid I’ll be able to force my way in, it’s really cool”
“Don’t do that, don’t do that, that’s expellable.”
“Fine” Theo sighed as he turned away towards the cafeteria.

OverFast was just about to turn away to go have lunch with Emily, when he saw a neatly folded piece of paper in his locker that he didn’t recognise.
In small handwriting it read “Hey, you probably don’t know me, I probably don’t exist for you, but I think you’re really cool.”
OverFast had never seen a message like this before. Sure, in the last week his newfound status as a moderator had persuaded a lot of girls to send him pictures, but a hand written note? That was new…
There was a tug on OverFast’s shirt sleeve. A girl was standing there. She waved, pointed at herself and then ran away down the corridor, without having said a word.
“Hey OverFast. Who was that?” Emily said, having just turned the corner towards OverFast’s locker. Emily was wearing short shorts and had a very tight crop top on. She was definitely looking for OverFast's attention.
“I don’t know…” OverFast replied, staring down the corrido the girl had run away down.
“Anyway, it’s time we had lunch together. I have something I want to show you. In private.” Emily grabbed OverFast’s hand and marched him towards the cafeteria.

## Chapter 4

Emily was sat opposite OverFast in the cafeteria, intensely looking into his eyes as he ate his egg sandwich.

“What do you want Emily?” OverFast asked her, tearing his eyes away from the girl that put the note into his locker. He was wondering if he should have gone over and said hello as she was sat all alone, not talking to anyone.

"Aren’t you going to ask what I was wanted to tell you?” Emily replied slyly, twirling her hair.
“Okay fine, what were you going to tell me?”
Emily burst out laughing. “Oh OverFast you’re so funny. Have I ever told you that? I’m sure I have. Oh have you been working lately? You’re the strongest man I know under five foot seven. Anyway, I wanted to ask if you’d ever thought about having kids before. Look I’m going to say something and I want to hear what you have to say about it. We should have kids as soon as possible. Look, I’m a virgin, you’re almost definitely a virgin but ever since you became a moderator on that minecraft server… I don’t know everything feels different. If you want to..”

“Hey everyone! There’s a fight going on outside!” Emily’s proposal was cut short as the whole of the school piled out of the cafeteria to catch a glimpse of the brawl going on outside.
“Whatcha going to do headass? Huh? You gonna try and run away?” Just outside the parking lot a circle had formed around a 6’4 beast of boy annihilating a tiny freshman.
“Please leave me alone” the boy cried “I just joined this school”
“I was tryna get to class and you got in my way. So I took my space back, that’s how capitalism works” the hulking boy snarled.

“BREAK THIS UP NOW”
Heads turned as an aged man with wispy tufts of white hair and a walking stick tottered towards the circle. This man was the principal, known to the students as NSA (a name he earnt for his inescapable watch over the school).
"This is a violence free zone" NSA said calmy. "o8f, get off of him NOW. Follow me to my office.”
“Wow, OverFast, we wouldn’t let our kid get away with this right?” Emily asked, turning to OverFast.
No reply came. OverFast had already left the parking lot, walking quickly back to the cafeteria, and more importantly the note girl.

## Chapter 5

"Hi. Thank you for the note." OverFast sat down opposite the note girl. In the empty cafeteria it felt like they were the only two people in the world.
"What's your name?" Overfast asked. No reply came.
"Can you hear me?". The girl nodded. She then took out a notebook from her kanken bag and started writing furiously. She tore out the page and passed it to OverFast.
It read: 'Hi, my name is Handpicked. First and foremost I don't like to talk, you'll just need to accept that if you're to going be acceptable in my friend environment. All this moderator business could get to your head and I think I can help you. For fuck's sake, yesterday you pinged 60 people on discord for no reason headass. What do you say?"
Overfast quickly read the note and looked up at Handpicked, who was already writing another note.
"I would love your help" OverFast said. Handpicked smiled and stood up. She grabbed her bag, slid OverFast another note and ran away. OverFast unfolded the note.

'By the way, I'm a boy...'

Later that evening OverFast was eating dinner with his dad. Overfast's dad was a very handsome man in his early forties with a sexy British accent.
"Hey Dad? Can I ask you something?"
"Course you can son. And remember son, we're equals in this house, call me by my first name"
"Okay, thanks Europa. Umm, this is awkward to say, but would you still love me if I told you I was gay?" OverFast asked, his voice trembling.
"Of course son, I will always be there for you no matter what happens. You're free to like anyone you like."
"Thanks Dad. That means a lot."
"If you don't mind me asking, is there anyone in particular you like son?"
"Maybe Dad, I'm not sure if they like me back though..."

## Chapter 6

OverFast was subdued as his dad drove him to school the next day.
“I’m sure things will be fine son, just take your time to work out what you’re feeling”, Europa comforted his son as he pulled up to the kerb outside of the high school.
“Thanks again Dad” OverFast replied smiling.
OverFast hopped out of the Nissan Maxima, determined to find Handpicked as soon as possible. It wasn’t going to be a simple task. Standing at the school gates, arms folded, were Emily and Kaitlyn Johnson.
“Listen here OverFast, I’m getting tired of your shit. You just ditched me yesterday after the fight. Look, we don’t have to have a kid right now if you don’t want, but at least treat me like your girlfriend” Emily spat at him. With anyone else she wouldn’t have taken this bullshit, but she always thought there was something special about egg boy.
“And we only talked like once and then you just ignore me” shouted Kaitlyn Johnson. “You’re gonna miss out on best thing that could ever happen to you if you don’t come with me. We could be having sex minutes from now if you wanted”. Kaitlyn hated acting like this but OverFast was a tier four donator now. She knew if they were together, she could get anything she wanted using OverFast’s mom’s credit card.
There was silence.
“WEE WOO WEE WOO” OverFast screamed, sprinting in between the two girls.
The girls stared at each other.
“You know as well as anyone that I don’t like you Kaitlyn”, Emily muttered, “But I will do anything to ruin that headass’s life right now. Are you in?”
“You know it” Kaitlyn replied.

OverFast quickly entered the school, moving very fast for someone with such short legs. He poked his head inside the first classroom he walked past.
“Hey guys, have you seen Handpicked anywhere?” OverFast enquired
“Haha no way. I think it’s a waste of time to look at 3D girls, they have way too many dimensions. Am I right guys?”. The rest of the room guffawed. OverFast had just so happened to enter the Red Dock Anime Club, or Weeb Land as it was known to the rest of the school. Apparently very proud of his joke, James stood up and pulled OverFast further into the room.
“I’m the president of this fine Anime Club. Together we welcome you!” James exclaimed.
“Konnichiwa, OverFast-san!” the room chorused.
James waited for the room to get back to their assorted weeb discussions and then pulled OverFast close and whispered in his ear “Look mate, I fuckin’ hate anime but these guys need all the help they can get. I know what it’s like to be bullied in school, my mum lives in Slough after all”
“Wow, I’m so sorry” OverFast replied. “That’s really brave of you to help these guys, poor things. I would stay and lend a hand but I’ve got to find Handpicked as soon as possible. I have got one question though about this club.”
“Shoot, mate.”
“Who’s that in the corner staring at you?”
James turned to look into the far corner of the room, in which a young man was standing.
“Oh fuck. That’s `[redacted]`. He just read a manga with a tsundere in and now he’s convinced he’s one too” James explained.
“Weird.”
“Yeah.”

“WHAT’S UP FUCKERS?”. The door was kicked open as Will, Theo and o8f burst into the room. “It’s time for ACTION!”
“Well, shit.” James sighed.
