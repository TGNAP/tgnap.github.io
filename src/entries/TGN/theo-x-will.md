Theo sighed when Overfast said he couldn’t punch a guy to get into a locked classroom. He really wanted to talk to Will too. Maybe more than talk, even.

He’d get another chance, he was sure.

Then, his finely tuned senses, honed for one reason only, perked up. “ACTION?” He yelled, sprinting down the halls.

Sliding down the halls for maximum speed he found the ACTION he craved. A large boy was walking away from a small freshman, laying on the ground. The big boy was following the principal NSA sadly. Oh well.

Thirsty for ACTION, Theo continued running towards the kid on the ground, then kicked him and proceeded to steal his backpack.

Now, he still needed to find Will. Theo heard will joined the anime club the other day, so maybe he could find him there.

Only there was an announcement. NSA said everyone had to meet in the gymnasium. Sighing that he had to delay his meeting with Will even longer, Theo went to the gym, surrounded by other people who weren’t really important.

“Because lots of people want it, fighting is now allowed. Also, you can keep everything you take off students you defeated.”

There were mass cheering and screams of terror and Theo began kicking freshmen. Through the crowd, Theo could also see Will kicking freshmen! Maybe they could do it together? He almost blushed at the thought.

However, there was another kid! The big one o8f was also beating up freshmen. He looked really good when doing it too. Theo though, kept Will foremost in his heart.

Soon though, the small weak freshmen had all run from the gym.

All the older students who thirsted for ACTION followed them. While following them, Theo was close to Will! Then, they turned a hall, finding themselves alone.

“Hey, Will.” Theo stepped closer.

“Yeah, Theo?” Will placed his hand on Theo’s buff chest (string from all the past ACTION).

“Seems we’re alone here.” Theo ran his fingers down Wills arms.

“Maybe.. We should move somewhere even more private?”

Then they leaned in, sharing a passionate kiss.

They made their way into an unused classroom, fumbling with eachothers belt buckles and- out of the corner of their eyes they saw the hall monitor Connor.

“Can’t you just let it go this time Connor?” Theo sighed.

“No.”
