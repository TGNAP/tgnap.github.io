# Alfredo x Reader (by HeyItsSirius)

"Alfredo no!" you call, as the man nears you on the hallway. You have seen it happen countless times before. The death that he brings. He approaches, in one hand some crudely-named sword, and in the other, a totem that prevents death, as if you would have a chance against him anyways. He laughs. Billy takes a bow off of his back and fires two shots: one to your left, and one to your right. The flaming arrows giving brief flashes of heat before they pin themselves in the ice highway you stand upon. You feel a cold sweat begin to drip down your forehead, as the distance between you and the highway raider draws ever closer. But... You cannot make yourself turn and run. You could never turn your back on AlfredoBilly. You would not dare to look away from him, for even a moment. He doesn't share the bond you seem to have with you. His blade penetrates your body, and you scream. You die. Upon respawning you complain about losing your most prized possessions, an enchanted (iron) sword and a stone pickaxe. You say that all donos are douchebags and they should just let people play. You are ridiculed by literally everybody, and log off, never to be seen again. The end.
