Dew was building on the grass, and a sweet scent of mildew and sweat persisted in the air.\nMuzak, a TGN mod, was wiping the sweat from his forehead, he had just finished typing up a ban for one of the many alts that had come that night. The alts did not think, they just had one purpose in mind, to destroy. They were like a hydra, ban one, and two more take its place. Not only were the alts, with their insatiable thirst for destruction, attacking Muzak, he was receiving a large amount of requests from the numerous civilized individuals on the server to help them with miscellaneous tasks. The pressure was building on Muzak, and he was tired. Muzak did not notice the alt, fresh off the welcome screen, creeping up on the baby turtle Muzak had so feverishly guarded all day. Muzak noticed, but it was far too late, the baby turtle seemed doomed to the world beyond, however, with the alt in mid swing, he vanished. The alt had been banned, by none other than OverFast, Muzak\'s colleague and close friend. OverFast, too, was tired. He had banned an influential player earlier in the day, and had been fighting his own battle with the alts. Despite his exhaustion, like Muzak, OverFast persevered, the debt he owed the server was too great. Both players had taken an oath the day they became mods, in the same application cycle. They swore to protect the server, its players, and its entities.\nMuzak released a pent up sigh of relief when he realized the turtle was no longer in danger. And Muzak looked gratefully towards OverFast. By now, the block sun had set and the block moon had risen. The sky was as deep a black as the dark irises of OverFast. The sickly scent filled the air, and it seemed to intoxicate Muzak. OverFast, who just that morning looked like a biased mod, apathetic towards his job, now seemed like the chiseled image of the perfect staff member. OverFast, was not unaffacted by the air either, and Muzak had been one of the most respected mods since the retirement of connor7000. As Muzak was losing himself in the deep dark of OverFast\'s eyes, and OverFast was reflecting in the bright white of Muzak\'s, an alt took his opportunity and creeped up on the turtle. Despite their deep fascination with each other, both were still experienced mods who were devoted to the server. The alt was banned as soon as he was in eyeshot, with Muzak claiming the message. "Darn!" OverFast exclaimed. "My ban has been stolen." Despite the frustration that seemed contained in the context of OverFast\'s message, everyone knew it was just loving banter. With no more alts in sight, and more soon to come, Muzak simply asked, "Want to write some bans together?".')]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"part-2"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#part-2"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Part 2")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v('OverFast was stunned. He had always been the type to assume flirtation was just being friendly, but this was clear evidence. He didn\'t know how to react. "Sure?" Said OverFast, with the upwards inflection at the end of the one word sentence that indicates a question. Muzak didn\'t know how to interpret this, "Do you not want to do it?" He asked. OverFast, for a second, was panicked, how could he have thrown away this oppportunity to be with the person whom he had been longing for for as long as he could remember? "No!" exclaimed OverFast, a little too quickly. "I do want to write some bans with you, in fact, I would really enjoy it." Muzak offered a small smile, the corners of his lips just barely reaching out of their neutral position, but the smile still conveyed the alacrity that Muzak really felt. The blocky moon behind them illuminated the sides of their faces, and a sense of hope pervaded throughout the moderators. They were excited to make this work and they were sure it would. Over the course of the next few days the attacks by the alt accounts slowed down and then stopped altogether. However, the lives of moderators are never over, and there was a new threat on the horizon--gaytown griefers. Despite the horrendous crimes being committed, Muzak and OverFast could not help but feel like it was destiny, a threat bringing them together in a place that celebrates relationships exactly like theirs. The two lovers were almost always online at the same time, and their ban messages took on a unique signature, instead of the ban being claimed by a single mod, their bans ended with the mark of "-Muzak and OverFast ❤️".\nEvery pixelated sunset painted the sky a deep purple and a light red, transitioning between them in a stunning pink gradient, and was watched by the pair. Of course, there was not only the sunsets to entertain them. A new movie was on the horizon, one both Muzak and OverFast were hopping up and down to see. The movie, Miners: Postgame, seemed like the perfect opportunity for the couple to go on their first real date. They had spent a long time together, sure, and they watched the sunset together every night. But they had never really gone someplace together. Moderating the sometimes irate players of the server was alot of work, and only allowed for the aforementioned viewings of the sunset and some quick, loving conversation in between bans. This, however, was too important, and the forming of their relatinship made it all the more important for the lovebirds. They made plans, got another mod to cover their timezone, and set out to view the masterpiece Miners: Postgame was certain to be. For almost 3 hours, they sat next to each other in a dark theater, inhaling each other\'s prescence. They lost themselves in the expanding universe of Miners and their quest to defeat the enderdragon. Without even looking at them, you could see their eagerness to see how Stage 2 of the Miners Universe finally came to an end, of course, they were also excited that they were watching it with someone important to them. Afterwards, they just talked and talked, discussing the films glorious crescendos and hidden theories. Soon, the discussion strayed from Miners: Postgame and they were conversing for the sake of it. Neither one of them wanted to leave this magical night, with the white light of the moon filtering through the windows, shining on the couple like the gentle touch of a deity.')])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
