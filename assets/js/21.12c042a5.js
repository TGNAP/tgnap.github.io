You have seen it happen countless times before. The death that he brings. He approaches, in one hand some crudely-named sword, and in the other, a totem that prevents death, as if you would have a chance against him anyways. He laughs. Billy takes a bow off of his back and fires two shots: one to your left, and one to your right. The flaming arrows giving brief flashes of heat before they pin themselves in the ice highway you stand upon. You feel a cold sweat begin to drip down your forehead, as the distance between you and the highway raider draws ever closer. But... You cannot make yourself turn and run. You could never turn your back on AlfredoBilly. You would not dare to look away from him, for even a moment. He doesn\'t share the bond you seem to have with you.
