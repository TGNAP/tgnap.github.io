His managers had just recommended he should get more experience interacting with human beings, a day at the register it was!\nThe first customer of the day entered the store in a calm and collected manner. Unbeknownst to him, Holotic had witnessed him illegally jay walking. “Thats illegal….” Holotic quietly murmured. “THATS ILLEGAL” He screamed.The customer, visibly perturbed by Holotic’s undying loyalty to his countries legal system began to take a few steps back. “MUZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK” Holotic screamed, “HE DID AN ILLEGAL”. By this stage, something was visibly wrong. Holotic was beginning to glow a sickly red colour. He slowly reached into his prison wallet and pulled out a tiny brown book with faint golden lettering reading “A complete documentation of the American Acts of Congress”.\nHolotic’s eyes turned black. The shops door swung shut. The lights began to flicker. A faint breeze, reminiscent of that which is produced by Holotic’s constant verbal diarrhoea swept across the customers face. “OOP̀̓͑SIE̓͆̚ WO̰OPSIE̎ͤ̀” He yelled. “G̮ͮŨ̎ͮE̱̭͙Sͯͣ̚S̰ Y̏Ō̓ͣU̬ͣ ͐̒̐DÍ̿D̙ ̏̎͛A̔ ̓͊͗F̋̅͐U͐̏C̟̓͗KIEͭ̈́̌ ̃͊͆W̑̓̈Ȕ̓̒C̟KḬ͆E̠͆ ̱̓H̩̱̣U̎͗ͨH̱̲”. Pushing the customer against the wall. Muzak suddenly burst into the scene. “HOLOTIC” He screamed. “REMEMBER YOUR BREATHING EXERCISES”. To Muzak’s detriment, Holotic, could not in fact remember any of his 12 meditations and 12 gentle breathing exercises for a clearer mind and a clearer life.\nBy now the situation was serious. Holotic’s skin was literally peeling off his face in rage. His voice took on a demonic tone. His eyes started to melt down his face, leaving deep wells of darkness under where his eyes should have been. With the customer resigned to curling up into a ball on the ground, it was then that Holotic truly understood the gravity of his situation. Feeling sympathetic, he took the gun from underneath the counter and granted the felon a quick and painless death, because Holotic was a kind soul after all.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=i.exports}}]);
