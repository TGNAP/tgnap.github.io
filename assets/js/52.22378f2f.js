james\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:55 PM] snekky#6713\nto make a channel for this location\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:56 PM] snekky#6713\nopportunity was the name we decided on as it was around the time that the rover's mission is declared completed\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:56 PM] snekky#6713\nso there was an #opportunity channel in red dock server\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:57 PM] snekky#6713\nfox and i got a flashy role\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:57 PM] snekky#6713\nwork on the map art continued\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:57 PM] snekky#6713\nmostly mining quartz\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:58 PM] snekky#6713\nduring this time we got red dock citizens to build houses on the land\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:58 PM] snekky#6713\nand convinced new players to join us\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:58 PM] snekky#6713\ni still didn't have a proper house\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:58 PM] Pixela#2609\nHaha me\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:58 PM] Pixela#2609\nI leeched off a tour smeg gave to someone who never played again\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:59 PM] snekky#6713\npopulation were rising\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 04:59 PM] snekky#6713\njames and pen disagreed on opportunity's position and if it should be its own town\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:00 PM] snekky#6713\nnot long after i discovered a fatal mistake in the plan\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:00 PM] snekky#6713\nthe map was upside down, the town faces south\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:00 PM] snekky#6713\nthis would not be much problem on its own\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:00 PM] snekky#6713\nbut koion, now foxrace did not know how maps work\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:00 PM] snekky#6713\nand the map art was 1x1 chunk misaligned\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:02 PM] snekky#6713\nby that time i didn't have much interest in moving the map art and continue\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:02 PM] snekky#6713\nas the then colony was growing fast\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:02 PM] snekky#6713\nthere were many things to do\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:02 PM] snekky#6713\ni was becoming known in the server\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:02 PM] snekky#6713\npartly because i shitposted in the discord server a lot\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:03 PM] snekky#6713\ni won't go into much detail about opportunity\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:03 PM] snekky#6713\nthere really isn't much to talk about\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:03 PM] snekky#6713\nafter the town has made its place on the server then it's nothing interesting to talk about\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:03 PM] snekky#6713\njust a town that grew very big\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:04 PM] snekky#6713\nand that pretty much concluded what i did on 1.13 server\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:04 PM] snekky#6713\nlet's talk about discord\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:04 PM] snekky#6713\ni was notorious for two things on the server\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:05 PM] snekky#6713\nposting anime and demanding feet pics\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:05 PM] snekky#6713\nas my interest in tgn dropped and dropped i cared less for what could happen on the discord\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:06 PM] snekky#6713\nso despite being muted and banned multiple times, why did i keep on posting even when i knew that the next one is permanent?\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:06 PM] snekky#6713\ni think it's fun\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:07 PM] snekky#6713\nthe reactions of people were fun\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:07 PM] snekky#6713\nand that i am a degenerate but that is pretty much known\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:07 PM] snekky#6713\nno mystery there\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:08 PM] snekky#6713\nas for the feet pics i am not sure how it started but i ended up getting a lot\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:08 PM] snekky#6713\ndon't worry most of them are gone now\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:08 PM] snekky#6713\ni don't think i was that much of an asshole on tgn server itself\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:09 PM] snekky#6713\nbut if you were ever active in a smaller server with me in it you probably noticed\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:09 PM] snekky#6713\nhearing a \"thank you\" was a notable occasion in red dock\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:09 PM] snekky#6713\nand james said that \"smeg never said anything nice to anyone\" or smth like that\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:09 PM] snekky#6713\ni would just get the fucking screenshot if not for wargen\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:10 PM] snekky#6713\nso there i was shitposting and arguing about politics in red dock\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:11 PM] snekky#6713\nmeanwhile i recruited some people, many of those are the originals in opportunity\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:11 PM] snekky#6713\nfor my new town in 1.14\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:11 PM] snekky#6713\ni told wargen to lock red dock server when 1.14 dropped\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:11 PM] snekky#6713\nand locked the server he did\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:11 PM] snekky#6713\nand hole was born\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:12 PM] snekky#6713\nit was a town about digging holes\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:12 PM] snekky#6713\nand dig holes we did\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:12 PM] snekky#6713\nok fine there wasn't as much digging as i would like\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713\ni started a new map art\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713\nit was going well\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713\ni took a lot of screenshot to prepare for the time lapse at the end\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713\nbut of course there is a catch\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713\ni needed a metric fuckton of snow\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:13 PM] snekky#6713\nso there i was farming a snow golem\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:14 PM] snekky#6713\ni visited some red dock people during this time\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:14 PM] snekky#6713\nmostly just pen and kai's base\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:15 PM] snekky#6713\nso i asked kai if they were interested in farming a snow golem to help me gather snow\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:15 PM] snekky#6713\nand then i set up a farming station in their base\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:15 PM] snekky#6713\nmoved it downstairs after a complaint from pen\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:16 PM] snekky#6713\nsome days later i came to collect my snow and discovered two things\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:16 PM] snekky#6713\n1.kai did not farm any snow\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:16 PM] snekky#6713\n2.pen got me killed\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:17 PM] snekky#6713\noh yeah i didn't mention my deaths at all\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:17 PM] snekky#6713\ni died from clogging a lot\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:18 PM] snekky#6713\ni died to a giant mushroom\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:18 PM] snekky#6713\nbut that's not part of the story\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:18 PM] snekky#6713\nso after i lost my 100th god set since 1.13 started\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:18 PM] snekky#6713\nhole imploded\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:18 PM] snekky#6713\nobscene amount of expletives were sent\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:19 PM] snekky#6713\nand i barely played after that\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:19 PM] snekky#6713\nthen i just went back to shitpost on discord (just hole now)\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:19 PM] snekky#6713\nand hole did not get very far\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:19 PM] snekky#6713\neveryone slowly felt that tgn sucked balls and left\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:19 PM] snekky#6713\nfox kept playing\n\n\n[14-Apr-20 05:20 PM] snekky#6713\nif you check tgn's minecraft chat you will see that i join to say
