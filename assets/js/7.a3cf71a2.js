It was attatched to a string leading to some weird mechanism. He looked around the room. Rays of sunlight revealed countless particles of dust hanging in the air. He swept into the air with his hand, to see the dust spiral around his hand. The air smelt like old wood and wool. He took a step into the shop and saw a wood counter. Behind the counter sat a brown haired man. Actually, sleeping would be the correct term. The man had brown curly hair. Mario gazed at the man for a while, admiring his looks. Mario felt he needed to sneeze and got panicked. He started walking over to the door, while trying to hold it in. He finally sneezed while trying to surpress it, but the damage had already been done. It may have sounded like this: "),t("em",[e._v("AA-GFBINEFVOIDGBNV")]),e._v('\nThe man behing the counter awakened abruptly. He sat up from the chair, not aware that Mario was there. The man looked around the shop. His gaze caught on to Mario who was just about to leave. He yelled out to him: "You there! Yes you! would you like to buy anything?" Mario turned towards the shop owner and said: "Oh.. uh, i just came in here cause of curiosity." The man\'s smile turned to a slight frown as he sat back down. Mario asked him: "Well, what\'s your name?" The man introduced himself as Ethan. Mario inspected Ethan for a while, admiring his curly brown hair, dark brown eyes. Ethan looked back at Mario with a weird expression. They both glared at each other for a beat longer than what was normal. Ethan looked away and scratched the back of his neck. He asked Mario: "So uhm.. did you  want to buy something? My name is Ethan by the way. What\'s yours? Mario looked down into the wooden floor and uttered: "m-my name\'s Mario."  "Mario huh?" Ethan stood up from his chair and walked over to Mario. He caressed his face while saying: "Are you sure you didn\'t come here for something else?" He gave Mario a wink as he walked slowly back to the chair. He sat down and gestured Mario to come over to him. Mario was reluctant at first but slowly crept towards him. When Mario had reached a close distance to Ethan, Ethan stood up from his chair and grabbed Mario\'s back head and they shared a passionate kiss. Mario was reluctant at first but got into it as time passed. Mario tore off Ethan\'s shirt, exposing his abs. Mario stopped for a while to admire his muscles. "Had i known a man like you were here, i would\'ve left my door wide open for you. They shared another long and passionate kiss. While so, they moved towards a flight of wooden stairs leading upwards. Ethan toom Mario\'s hand and led him up the stairs, They stopped at a door at the end of a hallway. Ethan opened the door where he found a room with a normal sized bed. The sheets and mattress both shared the color of deep green. The floor was littered with books. Mario did not care much of the mess in the room. He was too caught up in this man he had just met. Ethan threw Mario onto the bed. Ethan grabbed around mario and kissed him. Mario threw his shirt off into the corner of the room and kissed Ethan back. Ethan sat up for a moment and stopped what he was doing. Mario looked at him with a questioning look. "I\'ll be right back." He said while sprinting out of the room. He came back with a bottle of vodka in hos hands and 2 shot glasses. He filled a glass for himself and then one for Mario. Mario took ahold of the glass. Ethan said to him: "Cheers." And drank all the contents of the glass. Mario did the same thing, which left a bitter taste in his mouth. Mario downed a few couple more shots, before he blacked out. He awoke the next day feeling fuzzy. The rays of sun slipped in through the binds at the windows, revealing the dust dancing around in the air. He looked down at his side and saw Ethan laying there beside him. He tried to remember what had happened between them, but all he could remember was getting drunk and passing out. He looked around the room to a nightstand sitting at his left side. On the nightstand there were a pile of books. Mario grabbed one of the books and studied the cover. It said "How to Sex: A passionate look into your partner." Mario put the book back and sat up. Ethan awoke next to him and asked him: "So, how are you?" Mario replied with: "What happened last night?" "answering a question with a question, i see." Ethan replied. "I mean what happened between us." Mario continued. Ethan put on a smug face and said: "We had secks dude." Mario thought about it for a second. He thought about that he had just slept with what would be a staranger he had known for just a night. "Is something bothering you?" Ethan sked him. "Nah, i just had to think something through." Mario replied. Ethan scoffed and sat up. He rubbed his eyes before stretching his arms out and yawning. "I was thinking of heading down to starbucks later today, Want anything?" Ethan said, half yawning. Mario replied with: "Sure, actually why don\'t i just go with you?" Ethan smiled warmly at him and said: "Of course you can!" Ethan continued smiling at Mario for a while, before grabbing ahold of him and kissing him on his forehead. Mario stood up and grabbed his shirt from the corner. Ethan admired Mario\'s back muscles before he put on his shirt. They both walked together out of the door and down the stairs. They day was new and full of opportunity. Mario thought as he left the shop with Ethan following behind him. The sun gleamed in the distance as they walked together through the streets.')])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);a.default=h.exports}}]);
